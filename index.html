        INTRODUCTION
        Introduction
        Chaos is not the absence of order. Rather, it is
        the presence of infinite permutations of order,
        of possibility, each complete in and of itself
        and awaiting the moment, be it brief or eternal, when
        it will impose its structure on reality. The chaos
        mage is the architect of this imposition, changing at
        his whim the fundamental nature of reality from what is, to what he wishes it to be.
        The chaos mage is the antithesis of the wizard
        and the sorcerer. While their magic is all complex
        formula, rote recitation and memorisation, his magic
        is freeform and limitless, like chaos itself. For the
        chaos mage, there is no such thing as the impossible,
        merely the improbable.
        The chaos mage’s art is the magic of limitless
        potential, of destruction and building, beginnings and
        endings. In short, his magic is the stuff of creation. Now, thanks to Quintessential Chaos Mage, that
        magic is yours to command.
        The Collector Series
        The Quintessential Chaos Mage is the last title in
        Mongoose Publishing’s acclaimed line of class and
        racial sourcebooks, all of which are designed to
        greatly expand a player’s options when creating and
        playing his characters. Integrating nearly effortlessly
        into any fantasy campaign, these books are a valuable
        toolkit for both players and Game Masters alike,
        packed with new options, new rules and new ideas. The Quintessential range is designed to take your
        characters to new levels and your campaigns further
        than you ever thought they could go.
        The Quintessential
        Chaos Mage
        The Quintessential Chaos Mage builds directly upon
        the solid foundation and framework of Mongoose’s Encyclopaedia Arcana: Chaos Magic, expanding
        and fleshing out the concepts first presented therein. This book is intended to serve as a revision and
        replacement for the older work, introducing a new
        version of the chaos mage character class for use
        with Core Rulebook I.
        In addition to the revised chaos mage character class,
        this book contains a host of new character concepts
        and prestige classes, which will help to spark good
        roleplaying, and which serve to give even more
        options to a class already filled to bursting with
        them.
        The heart of this book is the revised and expanded
        rules for wielding chaos sorcery. Everything you
        need to create and cast freeform chaos magic is here,
        complete with new casting options and over a score
        of sample spells, to prepare you for creating your own
        potent spell effects.
        The revised core class and rules for spellcasting are
        supplemented with all manner of new feats, updated
        rules for creating chaos magic items, and for crafting
        familiars out of living chaos. There are expanded and
        revised rules for walking the Paths of Chaos as well,
        for none can resist chaos’ corrupting touch forever.
        The Quintessential Chaos Mage is filled, cover to
        cover, with new ideas, with new rules, and in the true
        spirit of chaos, with new possibilities.

        INTRODUCTION
        The old man opened his hands, light spilling from between his fingers. A glittering, pulsing sphere hung
        suspended between his cupped palms, of all colours and of no colour, perfect smoothness broken by delicate
        spirals, spikes and spires of light that rose up, blossomed and faded away again; sometimes dripping down into
        nothingness, sometimes bursting into fragments that glittered, sparked and flitted away like ash butterflies. ‘Do
        you believe in chance?’ he asked, his eyes resting on the glowing orb.
        ‘Yes, master, I do.’ The young man’s eyes were wide, fixed on the sphere.
        ‘You should not. Chance is the province of the ignorant, the coin of the fool, the mad and the desperate.’ The
        old man breathed, a single gentle puff, and the sphere began to spin, at first slowly, then faster and faster. ‘Look
        closely, boy, and tell me what you see.’
        The young man leaned closer, so close his nose almost brushed the orb as it spun. ‘I see... facets, master, facets
        like a jewel. And they change; sometimes there are more than I can count, sometimes only a handful.’
        The old man nodded and smiled. ‘Yes,’ he said, with perhaps a hint of pride, ‘And no. Those are not facets, at
        least, not like a jewel’s facets. What you are seeing is possibility, the possibility of you, my boy, represented in
        a form your mind is capable of understanding. The facets represent every possible choice you might make at
        every moment, every word you might say, every motion of your body, every pause or twitch which could change
        the nature of this moment; of each moment to come. That is what you see and that is what chaos is; choice’
        The old man parted his hands and the sphere shattered. He looked at the boy, holding his gaze for a moment. ‘When you learn, when you truly know, that you hold choice in the palm of your hand, that is when you will have
        the right to call yourself a chaos mage.’
        ‘But it all seems so uncontrolled, master.’
        ‘And it scares you, yes? That fear of the unknown. The knowledge that you are creating the laws of your art at
        the speed of your own thoughts.’
        The youngster paused, looking at his teacher with grave sincerity. ‘Yes, master, this knowledge I fear. What is
        the price that I must pay?’
        ‘Price?’ asked the old man.
        ‘Master, I am young but being brought up in a village without running water does not make me a fool. Were so
        much on offer without a price, then I would not be your only pupil.’
        The old man chuckled, patting the youth on the back and then tousling his hair affectionately. ‘You have not
        been my only pupil,’ and he paused wistfully, a streak of sadness passing across his visage. ‘There have been
        others.’
        ‘Where are they now, master, that I might meet them and share of their experiences?’
        ‘Sadly, my boy, that will not be possible. All my former students have gone far, far away.’
        ‘Why so, master, when the warmth and hospitality of your home is so well known? Does not one ever visit?’
        The old man glanced sadly out of the window, taking in the small orchard which bore the apples for which he
        had become justly famous. ‘You ask too many questions, my boy. There will be a time for such answers, but not
        now. Ask again another day, when my melancholia has receded.’
        The youngster nodded, unhappy with the rejection but too thoughtful and mannered to show it. Instead he
        nodded and withdrew, his eyes drawn to the shattered sphere.
        After the door had closed, the old mage stood slowly and limped across to the window. He stared out at the
        trees, looking at one in particular. It seemed at odds with the fine apple trees around it and, indeed, was unlike
        any other tree he had ever seen.
        He remembered his finest pupil and made a mental note to prune him the next fine day that came.

        THE CHAOS MAGE
        The Chaos
        Mage
        The Quintessential Chaos Mage and
        Encyclopaedia Arcana: Chaos Magic
        The rules presented in the Quintessential Chaos
        Mage are intended to supplement and build upon
        those first presented in Encyclopaedia Arcane:
        Chaos Magic. In all questions of rules interpretation,
        the rules here take precedence.
        There is no pattern to magic, save that which I give
        it. I am the loom. I am the hand. I am the weaver.
        There is no meaning to magic, save that which I
        assign it. I am the quill. I am the hand. I am the
        poet.
        There is no to will to magic, save that which I
        provide it. I am the whip. I am the hand. I am the
        master.
        The chaos mage is a character who directly taps
        into the primal forces of the universe, allowing
        him to affect changes in static reality. Though
        these changes manifest as arcane spell effects, the
        chaos mage’s powers are only tangentially related
        to the wizard’s prepared, formulaic incantations and
        only superficially similar to the spontaneous magic
        of the sorcerer, which is limited to certain specific
        expressions ingrained on the practitioner’s spirit.
        By contrast, the spellcasting powers of the chaos
        mage are limited only by the power of his imagination
        and his strength of will. A chaos mage who is truly in
        tune with his desires can, and will, stretch reality like
        taffy, twist and rip it as easily as a grown man shreds
        tissue between his fists. The greatest of chaos mages
        control reality on a scale comparable to that of minor
        deities, or the greatest of cosmic stewards; like those
        beings, the high level chaos mage imposes limits on
        reality, reality does not impose limits on him.
        The Chaos Mage
        Adventures: A chaos mage might choose to adventure
        for any number of reasons, ranging from base greed
        to enlightened humanitarianism. Frequently, a chaos
        mage will seek out the company of other adventurers
        and the thrill of exploration and combat for no other
        reason than excitement; after all, chaos thrives best in
        times of strife, conflict and ever changing fortune (a
        textbook definition of most adventures). Other chaos
        mages adventure to accumulate power and breadth of
        experience, the better to hone their spellcasting skills. Still others seek adventure because they recognise it
        to be the fastest, albeit most dangerous, method to
        accumulating wealth and earthly power; after all, the
        treasure horde of even a lesser dragon can found, or
        fund the overthrow of, a large kingdom.
        Whatever their reasons for choosing the life of
        adventure, chaos mages tend to have brief but
        spectacularly memorable careers, their bodies
        inevitably succumbing to the ravages of chaos, but
        not before affect great change across the width and
        breadth of the world.
        Alignment: In order to become a chaos mage, a
        character must be chaotic in alignment. Since chaos
        does not acknowledge the concepts of good or evil,
        a chaos mage can be otherwise good, evil or neutral,
        as his conscience guides him. Should a chaos mage
        change his alignment from chaotic, he may no longer
        advance as a chaos mage and loses the ability to cast
        chaos magic entirely.
        Religion: Chaos mages are restricted to the worship
        of gods of chaos and neutrality. The structured
        and heavily restricted dogmas of lawful gods are
        anathema to free spirited chaos mages. Lawful gods
        and their servants are likewise at a loss to understand
        the chaos mage’s nature.
        Chaos mages are most likely to worship those
        gods whose portfolios encompass and actively
        promote change, conflict, destruction, possibility
        and uncertainty. For this reasons, gods of war, of
        gambling and chance, of love, of fertility, of the
        elements, or of chaos itself (naturally) are most
        favoured, though they are by no means the only gods
        chaos mages worship.
        A small percentage of chaos mages reject the concept
        of worship outright. Having, as they believe, learned
        to manipulate the core structure of reality, they no
        longer feel that they have need of gods; indeed, some
        believe themselves to be awakened to the first steps
        of a journey which will lead them to divine ascension
        and a place among the existing gods. Note that this
        does not mean that these chaos mages discount the
        power and influence of the gods, rather that they
        5
        THE CHAOS MAGE
        simply see no reason to worship those they consider
        nothing more than especially mighty peers.
        Background: Chaos mages are a truly diverse lot,
        coming from all races and backgrounds. For further
        details on selecting an appropriate background for a
        chaos mage player character or non-player character,
        see the Character Concepts chapter of this book.
        One thing to always keep in mind is the chaos mage’s
        lack of focused, formal training. While a very lucky
        few with the potential to wield chaos energy will
        stumble upon, or be found by, a more experienced
        chaos mage willing to guide them, most will be
        forced to do for themselves, stumbling along and
        making mistakes until they discover what works best
        for them, or die in the attempt. Accordingly, most
        chaos mages have a strong independent streak and
        few long term ties.
        Races: A chaos mage can be of any race. Of all the
        races, humans, half-elves, gnomes and half-orcs are
        the most likely to pursue the way of the chaos mage;
        humans because the Path of Chaos is a quick road to
        power, gnomes because their whimsical minds bend
        easily to the concepts of chaos, half-orcs because it
        suits their essentially chaotic nature and because they
        do not fear deformity as other races do and half-elves
        because the notion of limitless possibility is naturally
        appealing to those denied so many opportunities in
        polite society. Conversely, elves and dwarves rarely
        willingly pursue the ways of the chaos mage. Elves,
        with their near millennia long life spans, rightly fear
        the corrupting effect of chaos on the body and mind,
        dreading the thought of spending centuries trapped
        in boneless, screaming flesh. Dwarves, with their
        near universal belief in the rightness of law and order
        actually fear the power of unleashed chaos, though
        they are loathe to admit this even to themselves. The
        other races choose the Path of Chaos as whim directs
        them – which is, perhaps, as chaos would want it to
        be.
        Other Classes: While even a novice chaos mage has
        the raw power and versatility necessary to survive as
        an adventurer, they find their greatest success when
        they work with allies whose abilities complement
        their own. Chaos mages tend to get on superbly with
        barbarians, whose barely restrained wildness appeals
        to the mage on both a personal and intellectual level. For the same reason, chaos mages get on well with
        many rogues and bards, as the members of both those
        professions thrive in moments of uncertainty and
        chaos.
        Wise chaos mages respect the fighting prowess of
        men at arms of all sorts and quickly cultivate good
        working relationships with fighters, rangers and
        especially the aforementioned barbarians. They are
        more reluctant to associate with monks and paladins,
        because while they respect their skills and dedication
        to their craft, they find it difficult to work with
        those who are so unswervingly dedicated to lives of
        structure and lawfulness.
        Chaos mages can and do work with druids and
        clerics, though they often come into conflict with
        both groups, as their interpretations of the true
        nature of the universe are often radically different. Still, so long as both parties agree to disagree, or
        at least agree to keep their opinions to themselves,
        there is no reason they cannot enjoy long and fruitful
        partnerships.
        The same cannot usually be said of relationships
        between chaos mages and more traditional arcane
        spellcasters. Wizards, with their reliance on mystic
        formulas and practiced, repetitive gestures and
        incantations, generally despise chaos mages and
        disparage them as out of control amateurs with no
        understanding of the forces they unleash upon the
        world. For their part, chaos mages see wizards as
        hidebound weaklings, simpletons forced to rely on
        musty tomes and alchemical formulas as one-legged
        men are forced to rely on crutches. Sorcerers and
        chaos mages enjoy a slightly better relationship, as
        the members of both groups respect one another’s
        ability to directly tap into the primal magic of the
        universe. Still, it is the rare chaos mage who considers
        a sorcerer his equal; most see them as inferiors who
        lack that essential spark of genius which would allow
        them to truly sculpt magic at will.
        Abilities: Nothing matters more to a chaos mage
        more than his ability to use sheer willpower to bend
        reality to his whims. Accordingly, Wisdom is the key
        ability of chaos mages. A wise chaos magician is also
        a long-lived chaos magician, as he understands better
        the balance of risk and reward inherent in wielding
        chaos energies.
        Chaos energies are savagely unpredictable and can
        easily ravage the mortal form. The most successful
        and long-lived chaos mages are those whose bodies

        are capable of resisting these potentially deadly
        transformations. Because of this, chaos mages
        tend to be physically more hardy than other arcane
        spellcasters, with endurance and strength comparable
        to that of a farmhand, woodsman or even warrior. A
        high Constitution score is also useful for chaos mages
        who wish to create and enjoy the benefits of chaos
        magic items, as their devices function only so long
        as the mage is willing to devote a portion of his life
        energy to maintaining them.
        Finally, a chaos mage with a compelling, winning
        personality should count himself lucky indeed; as the
        ravages of chaos manifest on his body (and they most
        assuredly will), only his ability to create and maintain
        friendships despite his grotesque appearance will save
        him from total rejection and unwilling isolation. A
        decent Charisma score can be all that stands between
        a chaos mage and embittered solitude.

        Class Skills: The following skills (and the relevant
        abilities) are all class skills of the chaos mage: Bluff
        (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (alchemy) (Int),
        Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Profession (Wis) and
        Spellcraft (Int).
        Skill Points Per Level: 2 + Int modifier.
        Class Features
        All the following are class features of the chaos mage
        class.
        Weapon and Armour Proficiencies: The chaos
        mage is proficient with all simple weapons, but has
        no proficiency with any armour or shields. A chaos
        mage who chooses to wear armour or bear a shield
        cannot feel the flow of chaos energy as well as he
        should; he suffers the same chance for arcane spell
        failure as other arcane spellcasters do, though the
        consequences for failure are considerably more dire. See the Chaos Sorcery chapter for full details of the

        magical effects. The Chaos Sorcery chapter presents
        the complete rules for creating and casting chaos
        magic effects, as well as a variety of sample chaos
        ‘spells’.
        Remember that a character who chooses the ways
        of chaos magic is forever more barred from the
        more traditional styles of arcane spellcasting. He is
        forbidden from multi-classing into any class which
        grants arcane spellcasting abilities. Nor may a
        character learned in traditional arcane spellcasting
        multi-class into the chaos mage character class (see
        the Choosing the Life of Chaos section for optional
        exceptions to this rule).
        Chaos Familiar: At 2nd level, the chaos magician
        gains a deep enough understanding of the energies
        he controls that he may use them to awaken sentience
        in raw primal matter, creating a chaos familiar. Chaos familiars are infused with the chaos mage’s
        own soul essence and are much more powerful than
        other arcane familiars. At the same time, however,
        the injury or death of a chaos familiar is much more
        devastating to the chaos mage than the loss of a
        traditional familiar is to a wizard or sorcerer. See the
        Chaos Familiars chapter for the complete details of
        an awakened chaos familiar’s abilities.
        Multiple Effects: When a chaos mage first come
        into his power, he is severely limited in the number
        of effects he may employ with each casting. As he
        gains a greater understanding of the ways and whims
        of chaos, so to does he gain a greater ability to twist
        multiple desired effects into a single spell. Beginning
        at 5th level, he can weave two spell effects into every
        casting. At 10th, 15th and again at 20th level, the chaos
        mage gains the ability to add yet more effect strands
        to each casting, so that at twentieth level he can
        cast a spell with fully five unique spell effects. For
        information on individual chaos magic spell effects,
        see the Chaos Sorcery chapter of this book.
        Chaos Countermagic: Beginning at 8th level, the
        chaos mage can, if he so chooses, unleash a raw burst
        of chaos energy capable of countering any static
        magic spell effect. This chaos effect is functionally
        identical to the counterspell ability of traditional
        arcane casters, with the following exceptions.
        A chaos mage need never attempt a Spellcraft skill
        check when attempting to counter a spell, as he is
        using sheer willpower to overwhelm the other caster’s
        arcane energies, rather than attempting to thwart a
        specific spell formula. Instead, he must succeed
        at a caster check against a DC of 10 + the spell’s
        level. A successful caster check means that the spell
        is countered, while a failed check leaves the chaos
        mage vulnerable to backlash and manifestations of
        the Paths of Chaos. See the Chaos Sorcery and Paths
        of Chaos chapters for complete details of backlash.
        Chaos countermagic is capable of countering any
        spell, even those which are not normally affected
        by counterspell. When used to counter such a spell,
        increase the spell’s effective level by one for the
        purposes of setting the chaos countermagic DC. The
        incredible versatility of chaos countermagic is rightly
        feared by traditional spellcasters and increases the
        distrust between the two groups.
        Chaos countermagic can never be used to disrupt
        divine spellcasting.
        Purge Chaos Magic: No one can ever fully escape
        the taint of chaos and all eventually succumb to its
        corrupting effects. Beginning at 12th level, however,
        the chaos mage learns enough about the nature of
        chaos and his own body, to allow him to harmlessly
        purge himself of some of the primal energy which
        permeates his body. Once a week, the chaos mage
        can purge himself of one level on a Path of Chaos. This has an associated experience point cost equal to
        500 experience x the level of the step to be negated.
        So, for example, should a chaos mage decide to
        purge himself of the eighth step on his Path of
        Chaos, he would be required to spend a total of 4,000
        experience points (8 x 500 = 4,000). Only one step,
        the highest step, can be purged in this manner each
        week. Should the chaos mage possess steps on two
        or more Paths of Chaos, he can only purge one step
        from one of his paths. See the Paths of Chaos chapter
        for more details.

        THE CHAOS MAGE
        Choosing the Life of
        Chaos
        The freeform mechanics of chaos magic presented here
        are a relatively new addition to d20 gaming, having
        been introduced first in Encyclopaedia Arcana: Chaos
        Magic. As such, it is very possible that this will be your
        gaming group’s first exposure to the concepts presented
        herein.
        It is equally possible that one or more of your players
        may wish to immediately take advantage of this book’s
        new class and spell casting mechanics, which can
        be a problem if you are in the middle of an existing
        campaign. Can be, but does not have to be.
        The first, simplest and least satisfying solution is to
        forbid access to the rules presented within this book
        until either the campaign ends, or until such time as
        an existing character dies or is retired from active play. There is nothing wrong with this approach, per se,
        but it can lead to dissatisfaction, with player’s coming
        to resent the fact they are ‘forced’ to either abandon
        characters they have spent weeks, months or years
        developing, or stick with characters they no longer wish
        to play. Additionally, delaying the introduction of these
        rules to your campaigns also means that your purchase
        will be left to languish on the shelf.
        The second solution, allowing players to convert
        existing characters to chaos magicians, is more
        satisfying, but brings with it its own problems. The
        optional rules presented below should prove useful to
        those who wish to integrate chaos magic into existing
        adventuring parties.
        Chaos magic and non-arcane spellcasting
        characters
        Granting non-arcane spell casting characters access to
        the rules herein is as simple as allowing them to multi-
        class into the chaos mage class, using the normal rules
        for multi-class characters. Divine spell casters can use
        chaos magic without issue – just keep in mind that
        divine caster levels do not add to chaos magic caster
        level checks when generating spell effects.
        Chaos magic and sorcerers
        Of all the existing arcane spellcasting classes, the
        sorcerer is the easiest to convert to the use of chaos
        magic, primarily because the sorcerer class does not
        benefit from many level granted abilities. With a bit
        of creative thinking and a spot of rewriting, a sorcerer
        can simply be converted to a chaos sorcerer. Should
        you choose this route, remember to account for the
        presence of an existing standard familiar; if possible,
        simply convert it to a chaos familiar, using the rules
        in the Chaos Familiars chapter. A kind Game Master
        should also allow the player to retroactively alter their
        character’s feat choices, should they wish to.
        A key difference between mid to high level sorcerers
        who are allowed to retroactively become chaos mages,
        and characters which began as chaos mages and achieved
        mid to high levels is this: the latter will undoubtedly
        have accumulated a few steps along one of the Paths
        of Chaos, while the former will still possess a body and
        spirit free of corruption. In order to compensate for
        this, it is recommended that a sorcerer be given one step
        along a chaos path for every three full class levels.
        Chaos magic, bards and wizards
        It is unfortunately not so easy to retroactively alter a
        bard or wizard to take advantage of the rules presented
        here. Characters of perhaps 1st to 3rd level can be
        retroactively changed to simply become chaos mages
        without too much issue, though both players and Game
        Master must be willing to overlook or explain away the
        disappearance of bardic music abilities and the (minor)
        loss of martial skill. It is not recommended that wizard
        or bard characters of fourth level or above be allowed
        to become chaos mages, as the mechanical changes are
        simply too comprehensive.
        The ‘Radiation Accident’
        Of course, having said that, there is still a way to justify
        the complete transformation of an existing bard or
        wizard to a practitioner of chaos magic; the radiation
        accident.
        The radiation accident is a well known tool in the
        comic book writer’s repertoire, a way to wipe the slate
        clean and justify wholesale alterations to an existing
        character’s powers. Like comics, fantasy gaming is rife
        with opportunities for ‘radiation accidents’. Encounters
        with mad gods, ancient dragons or demons, immersion
        in fields of multi-planar energy, curses levied by ancient
        artefacts or powerful witches. There really are a near-
        infinite number of ways to explain away even the most
        blatant changes to character mechanics.
        The key to implementing the ‘radiation accident’ is
        this – the character’s abilities change, but his essential
        personality does not. It is imperative that personality
        continuity be maintained, otherwise there is no
        difference between implementing a ‘radiation accident’ and simply introducing a brand new character.

        THE CHAOS MAGE
        It had all started innocuously enough. Bartleby had simply begun questioning the value of money. Sure enough,
        it was strange, but Bartleby had always been the black sheep of the family.
        So reasoned Chatsworth Rockbottom, Bartleby’s younger brother and companion both in magic and adventuring
        these past six summers. But Bartleby Rockbottom III had most certainly changed of late, there was no doubting
        that.
        Chatsworth recognised the wild streak in his older brother for, while he himself was a bookish sort of mage, never
        happier than when deciphering some old piece of parchment, Bartleby was a different fish, seemingly procuring
        spells out of thin air, almost on a whim. It could be quite disconcerting to see him suddenly glow a fluorescent
        green before passing wind – it was a combination which meant strange magic was about to happen.
        Their friends, Aesip and Serge, had acquired the invitation to the prestigious party that they were now attending. How they had done it was of no consequence, but it promised to be a great opportunity to cultivate some
        acquaintances in a strange town and partake of some decent food and grog for a change.
        ‘Look at the melons on her!’
        Chatsworth looked around, astonished. The words had been uttered by Bartleby, who was looking up at a
        curvaceous – well, that was being kind – human lady of advancing age who appeared to be playing some part
        in hosting the event.
        ‘Fworr, I’d like to sort her out!’ added Bartleby, his mouth dangling open in anticipation.
        ‘You what?’ demanded Chatsworth, his voice a whisper. ‘For one thing she’s damned near three feet taller than
        you and of a completely different species, plus she looks like the back end of a chariot.’
        ‘My tastes are more eclectic these days,’ his brother informed him. ‘I’m a gnome of the world, don’t you
        know?’
        ‘You’re a randy midget is what you are,’ said Serge, who had listened in growing disbelief as the two gnomes had
        discussed Bartleby’s sexual appetites.
        ‘Cobblers!’ replied Bartleby, seemingly unconcerned by his fellows’ reactions to his... needs. Yes, needs, that
        was what he had. After all, everybody had needs, didn’t they? Why were they picking on... ‘I bet she goes!’
        That had been loud. In fact, very loud. Loud enough for the target of the opinion to hear it.
        ‘Did you address me, little man?’ she asked.
        ‘Of course he didn’t,’ interjected Chatsworth quickly. ‘Why would a gnome make lewd comments about a half-
        orc? Most unlikely.
        ‘Hrmph,’ muttered the half-orc, striding away. ‘I’ve got my eye on you, mister.’
        Bartleby had suddenly felt the need to remove his trousers and show her just what she was missing but a cuff
        round the ear from his brother ruined the moment. ‘What on earth has got into you?’ demanded Chatsworth, his
        face bright red. You’re behaving like a drunken Northman.’
        ‘I have needs,’ announced Bartleby, pompously.
        ‘Good evening, small gentlemen,’ said a voice, interrupting Bartleby’s impending definition of just what those
        needs amounted to. The two gnomes looked up to see a charming elf standing before them. He was gloriously
        dressed and appeared to be of considerable importance.
        ‘Can we be of service?’ offered Chatsworth, quickly, in case Bartleby propositioned the fellow.
        ‘I thought perhaps that you were the jesters that I had been expecting.’
        ‘I’m not sure what you mean,’ replied Chatsworth, although he had a fair idea. Perhaps with a bit of tact they
        could yet get out of what was rapidly degenerating into the Party from Hell. It would take some doing, but...
        ‘Hey, big ears, fancy a threesome with the fat bird over there?’ asked Bartleby.
        10
        CHARACTER CONCEPTS
        Character
        Concepts
        What drives a man to seek out the strength
        of the maelstrom of chaos? What facet of
        personality leads a woman to abandon the
        security of predictability for the deeper, quicksilver
        truths which pulse beneath reality’s skin? Is there
        a common thread which links those who wield the
        power of chaos? Do all hunger for knowledge and
        easily achieved power?
        In a word: maybe. In two: maybe not.
        Truthfully, there is no one belief, background or
        mindset common to practitioners of chaos magic. For every savant immersed unwillingly from birth
        in a womb of endless change, for every woman
        terrified of the power which wells up unbidden to
        fulfil her subconscious desires, there is a philosopher
        who discovered and embraced wholeheartedly the
        freedom of serving unbridled possibility.
        By necessity then, the character concepts presented
        below are more concerned with the attitudes, abilities
        and goals the character developed in the time since
        he chose to walk the winding Paths of Chaos. The
        concepts below are broad archetypes, each themed
        around a particular manner in which chaos chose to
        express itself; pick carefully, because the choice you
        make here will, sometimes radically, alter the way in
        which your character uses his powers.
        What are Character
        Concepts?
        Character concepts are miniature templates which
        can be applied to your characters. They are intended
        to provide ready hooks for roleplaying, and to give
        advice and inspiration for playing your character. In addition, every character concept includes one
        or more benefits and penalties, which are game
        mechanics intended to bring your character’s abilities
        more in line with his concepts.
        No character may have more than one character
        concept; though the concepts presented below change
        the nature of your character’s powers, they do not
        supersede his base class. That is to say, a chaos mage
        who selects one of these concepts cannot later multi-
        class into a chaos mage with a different concept. These character concepts are also intended for new
        characters, meaning a character who multi-classes
        into the chaos mage class cannot normally select
        one. With the Games Master’s permission, however,
        a player can select one chaos mage concept, so long
        as he does not already have a character concept
        from his original class. Should the Games Master
        allow this, he should work with the player to select a
        suitable concept, adjusting the bonuses and penalties
        as appropriate.
        This chapter is broken down into two parts. The first
        presents character concepts which are suited to chaos
        mage characters of any race. The second section
        presents character concepts which are restricted to
        specific character races. While no more powerful
        than other concepts, their specific benefits, penalties
        and roleplaying hooks are designed with specific races
        in mind. As such, these concepts can only be selected
        for characters of races other than the intended with
        the specific permission of the Game Master.
        Finally, always remember that the concepts presented
        here are intended to be tools to facilitate good
        roleplaying, not just a new mechanic to give you cool
        powers. When selecting your character’s concept, it
        is important that you pick one which you will enjoy
        exploring for some time, and which will fit well with
        the campaign and the rest of the group.
        Format
        The character concepts presented below are slightly
        different than those in other Quintessential books. The concepts presented here are based around what
        effects the character can and cannot achieve with his
        chaos magic – while there is, of course, information
        on roleplaying and suggestions on appropriate
        backgrounds, the focus of this work is on the
        interaction between the character and his magic and
        what it means for him.
        The Breaker
        Chaos is destruction, it is terror, it is fire and ice
        and acid and thunder, a ravening, churning void
        with the power to rend all of creation asunder. It is
        within chaos’ power to erode the pillars of heaven, to
        unravel the bindings of existence, to smash down all
        that is and all that ever shall be – and it is within the
        breaker’s power to unleash that fury.
        11
        CHARACTER CONCEPTS
        The breaker is a chaos mage who has a natural affinity
        for using chaos to destroy. This affinity provides him
        with a measure of protection from the negative effects
        of a chaos backlash, cushions him from the brutal
        consequences of a failed caster check and makes it
        easier for him to cast Direct Damage-based chaos
        spell effects.
        Roleplaying: The breaker is a warrior, a guardian,
        a killer and a saviour. His magic is the magic of
        conflict and destruction and he is most at home on the
        battlefield, unleashing dreadful spells which ravage
        men and structures with equal ease.
        The typical breaker has given himself fully to the wild
        fury of chaos. He is passionate, lives for the moment,
        and never takes the long-term view about anything. Breakers are lusty and barely controlled, both on the
        battlefield and in their public dealings. They have
        trouble making and keeping friends, at least among
        the common folk; kindred spirits to warriors of
        all sorts, breakers are intensely loyal to those
        who prove their worth in the crucible of
        combat, the one true way to take a man’s
        measure – at least to their mind.
        Why Play a Breaker?: The breaker is
        ideal for those players who love to unleash
        widespread destruction, to hammer their
        foes with enormous gouts of fire and to
        shatter high towers with a single torrent of
        ravening chaos. Breakers are also terrific for
        those players who use gaming as a form of stress
        relief, where they can unleash their aggressions on
        hapless orcs and dragons with wild abandon. At
        the same time, that is not all a breaker can be. They
        make ideal avengers (for good or evil) and are natural
        choices in those campaigns which feature larger than
        life, mythically-styled heroes.
        Adventuring: Breakers prefer adventures which
        allow them to unleash the full fury of chaos, meaning
        they thrive best in times of battle and open war. They
        are ideally suited to, and greatly enjoy, the traditional
        types of fantasy adventuring; dungeon delving,
        dragon slaying and wizard smiting.
        Most breakers actively seek out adventure, as the
        killing arts are not well suited to a more sedentary
        lifestyle. These chaos mages enjoy the company of
        fighters and barbarians and are of a more rough and
        tumble cut than other spellcasters.
        Some few breakers, however, prefer more peaceful
        lives, setting themselves up as protectors or ‘owners’ of either remote villages or, if they have enough
        power or raw arrogance, major cities. Adventures for
        these types of characters tend to involve protecting
        what is theirs from external assault to internal
        usurpation. This type of chaos mage can be a
        benevolent shepherds or malevolent dictator, as their
        morals dictate.
        Benefits: Breakers know better than anyone how
        to unleash torrents of pure chaos energy, to rend,
        to destroy, to break. They are in every sense the
        quintessential war mage.
        First, they gain a +2 bonus to all final casting DC
        checks when casting a spell which is solely a Direct
        Damage-based
        effect, or
        12
        CHARACTER CONCEPTS
        which has Direct Damage as its primary effect (see
        the Chaos Sorcery chapter for full details).
        Second, should the breaker fail a final casting DC
        check when attempting to cast a spell which is solely
        a Direct Damage-based effect, or which has Direct
        Damage as its primary effect, he suffers nonlethal,
        rather than lethal damage. The exception to this is
        when a ‘1’ is rolled, in which case backlash and lethal
        damage occur normally.
        Penalties: Breakers do not have the same capacity
        to force chaos magic to create as their fellow chaos
        mages do. Theirs is the magic of flame, wind, pain
        and death, and while they can certainly create swords
        and other implements from chaos, they cannot do it
        without great cost.
        A chaos mage breaker suffers a -2 penalty to all final
        casting DC checks when casting a spell which is
        solely a Materialisation-based effect, or which has
        Materialisation as its primary effect. Further, they
        suffer normal, rather than nonlethal, damage when
        casting Materialisation effects, even with a successful
        caster check.
        In the case of spells which combine Direct Damage
        and Materialisation effects, the bonuses and penalties
        to caster checks cancel one another, meaning the
        breaker makes caster checks with no bonus and
        no penalty. Damage is applied normally, namely
        nonlethal for successful caster checks and lethal for
        failures.
        The Maker
        Chaos is ultimate, endless potential. Its energy can
        be forged, harnessed, directed and channelled to
        create magnificent works of art, swords and armour,
        plowshares, soaring palaces and ramshackle hovels,
        and even semi-sentient constructs in the shape of
        clockwork beasts or pure, liquid uncertainty.
        The maker is a chaos mage who has a natural affinity
        for using chaos magic to create objects and illusions;
        Materialisation effects in other words. This affinity
        provides him with a measure of protection from the
        negative effects of a chaos backlash, cushions him
        from the brutal consequences of a failed caster check
        and makes it easier for him to cast Materialisation-
        based chaos spell effects.
        Roleplaying: The maker is a thinker and a dreamer,
        the Renaissance Man of chaos mages. The maker
        pursues knowledge for its own sake; he is an
        enthusiastic creator of both art and craft, an architect
        of dream, of idea, of form and of function.
        The typical maker would vastly prefer to spend his day
        creating fine works of art with his powers, or forging
        pure chaos energy to create tools and weapons. Makers know that their creations are temporary
        and fragile, and this makes them both melancholy,
        because they know better than anyone that nothing
        is permanent, and pragmatic, because they do not put
        much store in possessions. This combination can
        easily make them fatalistic, and some are, but most
        chaos makers accept the transitory nature of creation
        as the truest part of the natural order.
        Why Play a Maker?: Makers are terrific in
        supporting roles, meaning they are ideal characters
        for those players who like to take the role of defender
        and protector. Their powers are also thematically
        ideal for characters who hope to create great works, or
        13
        CHARACTER CONCEPTS
        which prefer to build, rather than destroy, in general. Makers are also good choices for those players who
        prefer intellectual challenges – since it is more
        difficult for them to simply damage enemies, they
        must come up with alternative means of overcoming
        challenges.
        Adventuring: Makers favour adventures which allow
        them to create grand works, whether those works
        be illusory or real. They know that no matter how
        powerful and experienced they become, the objects
        and images created are doomed to be only temporary
        in nature, fading away in just minutes or hours. Still,
        makers know that even a sword which exists just for a
        moment can change the course of history.
        Makers enjoy studying the subtle interactions of
        components, and how those interactions contribute
        to and create the universe, so they enthusiastically
        pursue rumours which may lead them to discovering
        secrets of the creation of reality. For much the
        same reason, makers are fond of puzzles and other
        intellectual conundrums, becoming enthusiastic
        students of science and machinery, so adventures
        which test their intellect will always pique their
        interest.
        In an adventuring party, the maker will take a
        supporting role, creating illusions to distract enemies,
        forging armour and weapons of pure chaos to
        strengthen his companion’s or crafting walls to thwart
        pursuers. Makers are also often the chief thinkers
        and planners of their band, creating strategies and
        directing actions in and out of combat.
        Compared to other chaos mages, the maker is a bit of
        a strange bird, with a tendency to prefer the company
        of those who appreciate and practice mastery of
        skill. This means that they get on well with those
        rogues who specialise in crafting and disabling traps
        and locks, and with fighters who prefer precision to
        brawn. They even tolerate the company of wizards
        and monks, at least more than their fellow chaos
        mages do, since they have an appreciation of (and
        fondness for) the complexities of arcane formula or
        martial arts techniques.
        Benefits: Makers know better than anyone how to
        take the weird elements of chaos energy and change
        them on a fundamental level, creating objects and
        illusions with effortless ease. This provides them
        with several bonuses.
        First, they gain a +2 bonus to all final casting
        DC checks when casting a spell which is solely
        a Materialisation-based effect, or which has
        Materialisation as its primary effect element (see the
        Chaos Sorcery chapter for full details).
        Second, should the maker fail a final casting DC
        check when attempting to cast a spell which is
        solely a Materialisation-based effect, or which has
        Materialisation as its primary effect, he suffers
        nonlethal, rather than lethal damage. The exception
        to this is when a ‘1’ is rolled, in which case backlash
        and lethal damage occur normally.
        Penalties: Chaos mage makers use chaos energy to
        construct, to create, to build. Theirs is not the magic
        of destruction. As such, they find it difficult, but
        by no means impossible, to unleash chaos as pure
        destructive energy.
        A chaos maker suffers a -2 penalty to all final casting
        DC checks when casting a spell which is solely a
        Direct Damage effect, or which has Direct Damage as
        its primary effect. Further, they suffer lethal, rather
        than nonlethal, damage when casting Direct Damage
        effects, even with a successful caster check.
        In the case of spells which combine Materialisation
        and Direct Damage effects, the bonuses and penalties
        to caster checks cancel one another, meaning the
        maker has no bonus or penalty when casting such
        spells. Damage is applied normally, namely nonlethal
        for successful caster checks and lethal for failures.
        The Master
        Chaos is choice, it is endless possibility. Within the
        unbounded sea of chaos rests every possible option,
        every possible thought, every possible action which
        could be made for any and every decision, from now
        until the end of time.
        But choice can be turned against itself, can be
        made to serve selfish ends. No matter how many
        possibilities a choice offers, eventually one must be
        chosen. Chaos magic, though, can be used to force
        choice, to determine possibility against the will of
        those it affects, or to confuse choice, to offer so
        many possibilities that the mortal mind can never sift
        14
        CHARACTER CONCEPTS
        through them all – the result, confusion, paralysation,
        or worse.
        The master is a chaos mage with an innate command
        of Domination effects. His abilities allow him to
        control minds, to influence emotions and to direct
        the course of mortal events. A low level chaos mage
        with the master concept can chance the fate of a city;
        a high level one the fate of a world.
        Roleplaying: Some masters are arrogant and self
        serving, seeing no harm in dominating the minds
        of others for any reason. Little better than slavers,
        these masters would quite willingly destroy
        a child’s psyche just to stop it from
        crying. Enthusiastic users
        and gluttons, these same
        chaos mages would think
        nothing of paralysing
        a victim’s mind, if it
        meant they could take
        their carnal pleasure
        with its immobile
        flesh.
        Other masters tap
        their power only
        when forced to, or
        only in defense of
        those who do not share
        their gift, or at least
        only towards what they
        consider noble purposes. Such mages will influence
        peace negotiations, watch over
        social gatherings to ensure the enjoyment
        of all, or pacify the minds of those who wish to
        commit violence. It is not uncommon for especially
        heroic masters to patrol the city streets at night,
        preventing murder, rape and theft by subtly altering
        the intentions of would be criminals.
        Most masters fall somewhere between these two
        extremes. They walk the fine line between selfish and
        responsible uses of their powers. Of all the various
        types of chaos mages, the master faces the hardest
        road from a moral standpoint – when the paths of the
        mind are laid bare, one must be ever vigilant to avoid
        giving in to temptation.
        Why Play a Master?: The master is the best choice
        for those players who like to take the role of the
        manipulator, the power behind the throne, or even the
        master sleuth. His powers are well suited to those
        who prefer subtlety in their game play and enjoy the
        idea of fooling or simply outsmarting their enemies.
        From a mechanical standpoint, the master can be a
        truly dangerous character, capable of ending a fight,
        or even an adventure, almost before it has begun. While they do not have access to divination (see the
        Chaos Sorcery chapter for a discussion of the limits
        of chaos magic), the master’s ability to seize control
        or change the thought patterns of enemy minds
        is formidable. If that thought appeals,
        then the master is the right concept
        for you.
        Adventuring: The master
        might adventure for any
        number of reasons, the
        acquisition of earthly
        power chief among
        them. Most chaos
        mages with the
        master concept enjoy
        the notion of exerting
        their will upon the less
        capable, even if they
        restrict themselves solely
        to using their abilities
        on the evil and the
        misguided.
        Masters prefer
        adventures which involve
        heavy amounts of intrigue,
        as their powers are well suited to
        subtle use. This means that many masters prefer not
        to adventure in the traditional sense at all and would
        rather remain safe within the confines of civilisation,
        using magic to build a power base of ensorcelled
        allies. Adventures for such masters should involve
        them attempting to accumulate even more civic
        power, or fending off the efforts of those who would
        take their wealth from them. Masters of this sort work
        well with socially oriented classes, particularly bards
        and rogues who focus on Charisma-based skills. They will work with fighters and other warriors, but
        consider all but the most socially gifted of them to be
        15
        CHARACTER CONCEPTS
        oafs, suitable only for stopping arrows and serving as
        bully-boys.
        Other masters, however, enjoy the challenge of
        turning their magic against the unknown dangers to
        be found in dungeons and at the far corners of the
        world. These characters will enthusiastically pit their
        spells against brigands, rogue adventurers, mad god-
        kings, demons and dragons, simply to see if their will
        is the stronger. In an adventuring party, such masters
        take the role of behind the scenes manipulators,
        standing at a distance, behind the cover of their more
        ‘confrontational’ allies, using magic to either paralyse
        enemies or turn their minds against their fellows.
        Masters of all sorts are ideally suited for social
        interactions and adventuring, as their powers can
        lay bare the intentions of others, twist their words
        and have staunch friends and lovers at each other’s
        throats, all in the space of a single day.
        Benefits: The master has an innate understanding of
        those magical effects which influence, dominate and
        destroy mortal minds. As such they have a natural
        affinity to spells which involve Domination effect
        elements.
        First, they gain a +2 bonus to all final casting
        DC checks when casting a spell which is solely a
        Domination-based effect, or which has Domination
        as its primary effect (see the Chaos Sorcery chapter
        for full details).
        Second, should the master fail a final casting DC
        check when attempting to cast a spell which is solely
        a Domination-based effect, or which has Domination
        as its primary effect, he suffers nonlethal, rather than
        lethal damage. The exception to this is when a ‘1’ is rolled, in which case backlash and lethal damage
        occur normally.
        Penalties: The magic of the master is the magic of
        confinement, of capture, of forced capitulation. It
        holds no truck with freedom and has no understanding
        of the notions of personal choice. As such, the
        master finds it difficult to work those magics which
        encourage freedom in any way, shape or form.
        The master suffers a -2 penalty to all final casting
        DC checks when casting a spell which is solely a
        Movement-based effect, or which has Movement as
        its primary effect. Further, they suffer lethal, rather
        than nonlethal, damage when casting Movement
        effects, even with a successful caster check.
        In the case of spells which combine Movement and
        Domination effects, the bonuses and penalties to
        caster checks cancel one another, meaning the master
        makes caster checks with no bonus and no penalty. Damage is applied normally, namely nonlethal for
        successful caster checks and lethal for failures.
        The Sculptor
        Chaos is the ultimate expression of change; it is
        transformative and transcendent, with the power to
        fundamentally alter the nature of living and nonliving
        matter. At a whim, chaos can cause reality to flow
        like liquid, it can transform air to stone and back
        again, it can give the blind sight, or cause sunlight to
        drip from the sky like rain.
        The sculptor is a chaos mage with the skill and
        understanding to control this, the most potentially
        powerful of chaos’ myriad attributes. His abilities
        allow him to change the shape of living beings and to
        alter the molecular structure of living and nonliving
        matter alike.
        Roleplaying: Sculptors see the world with an artist’s
        eye and they are kindred spirits to makers. The
        typical sculptor believes wholeheartedly in every
        mortal’s ability to transcend the limits of the form
        they are born with, to change, to evolve. Many take it
        upon themselves to guide their fellows upon this path
        to evolution; good-hearted sculptors act as teachers,
        the more morally dubious as surgeons and literal
        sculptors of flesh.
        Since they can so easily change the nature of reality,
        sculptors rarely put faith in the immutability of
        anything. They are adaptive and easy going, able to
        anticipate change, compensate for it and direct it to
        serve their ends. As a result, they are rarely surprised
        by anything and may indeed be rather blasé about
        life.
        Why Play a Sculptor?: Sculptors are excellent
        characters for players who prefer the image of
        spellcasters as alchemists, as their powers allow
        them to accomplish many of the miracles historical
        alchemists were famed for. They are also excellent
        choices for those players who want to turn their
        16
        CHARACTER CONCEPTS
        enemies into toads, or bits of brick, or into sunlight
        and songbirds, for that matter.
        Like the maker, the sculptor is also a great class for
        those who think unconventionally. Since it is difficult
        for them to rely on Direct Damage effects to escape
        trouble, they must be prepared and able to think
        outside the box.
        Adventuring: Sculptors rarely, if ever, adventure
        for wealth. Though the transformative effect of their
        spells only lasts a few hours at most, they still have
        no problem creating what wealth they need. Since
        they do not pursue wealth for its own sake, they will
        rarely ally themselves with mercenary bands, or with
        typically greedy adventurers.
        Most sculptors adventure in pursuit of a higher ideal,
        usually the idea of self-perfection. Since challenge
        and combat is the best way to push the limits of a
        mage’s capabilities, that is what they seek out.
        Other, more civically-minded sculptors seek out
        and challenge those who would force stagnation
        on others, since they see the inability to change, to
        evolve, as the worst hell imaginable. These sculptors
        are usually good aligned, though they need not be, as
        evil sculptors are equally offended by stagnation.
        In the party, the sculptor will most often take the
        supporting role, altering his allies forms to better
        allow them to take advantage of local terrain, or
        protect them from local environments. Alternately, he
        might choose a more proactive course, turning enemy
        weapons into butter or transforming opponents into
        harmless statuary.
        Benefits: The sculptor has a knack for using
        chaos magic to alter the fundamental structure
        of both objects and living beings. He gains
        useful bonuses when casting spells which
        include Transformation effects, as listed
        below.
        First, sculptors gain a +2 bonus to all final
        casting DC checks when casting spells which
        are solely Transformation-based effects, or
        which have Transformation as their primary
        effect (see the Chaos Sorcery chapter for full
        details).
        Second, should a sculptor fail a final casting
        DC check when attempting to cast a spell
        which is solely a Transformation-based effect,
        or which has Transformation as its primary
        effect, he suffers nonlethal, rather than lethal
        damage. The exception to this is when a ‘1’ is rolled, in which case backlash and lethal
        damage occur normally.
        Penalties: The sculptor’s magic is intended
        to change, to sculpt and to recreate, not to
        destroy. Due to this, the sculptor finds it
        difficult to cast spells which include Direct
        Damage effects. He is not prevented from
        using them, he simply finds it more difficult
        and taxing to do so.
        17
        CHARACTER CONCEPTS
        A chaos mage sculptor suffers a -2 penalty to all
        final casting DC checks when casting a spell which
        is solely a Direct Damage-based effect, or which has
        Direct Damage as its primary effect. Further, they
        suffer lethal, rather than nonlethal, damage when
        casting Direct Damage effects, even with a successful
        caster check.
        In the case of spells which combine Transformation
        and Direct Damage effects, the bonuses and
        penalties to caster checks cancel one
        another, meaning the sculptor
        makes caster
        checks with
        no bonus
        and no
        penalty.
        Damage
        is applied
        normally,
        namely
        nonlethal for
        successful caster
        checks and lethal
        for failures.
        The
        Traveller
        The eternal force of chaos
        recognises no borders and
        no boundaries. Chaos has
        no concept of distance,
        time or space; to chaos, one
        space is all space and a single
        footstep forward can carry you
        across galaxies – or a single step.
        The traveller is a chaos mage who
        has a natural affinity for Movement
        elements (see the Chaos Sorcery chapter for
        full details of Movement effects). This affinity
        provides him with a measure of protection from the
        negative effects of a chaos backlash, cushions him
        from the brutal consequences of a failed caster check
        and makes it easier for him to cast Movement-based
        chaos spell effects.
        Roleplaying: Most travellers have vagabond hearts
        and souls. They are uncomfortable remaining in
        one place for long and are only truly happy when
        exploring new vistas. To be a traveller is to forever
        hunger to know what awaits behind the door, over the
        next hill, beyond the sparkling sea and outside the
        confines of what mortals believe to be the confines of
        the universe.
        Due to their incessant need to experience the journey,
        travellers are loathe to set down permanent roots in a
        community, though wealthy travellers, such as high
        level adventurers, will sometimes purchase
        homes in both major cities and remote
        villages, the better to guarantee a
        safe haven wherever fate and
        whim brings them to next.
        Why Play a Traveller?:
        Mechanically, characters
        with the traveller concept
        are perfect fits in parties
        which intend to have
        world (or dimension)
        spanning adventures. Their enhanced ability
        with Movement effects
        guarantees that their
        chaos magic will
        be there for them
        whenever they need
        a quick escape, and
        allows them to craft
        larger spells sufficient
        to support or transport
        their companions when
        necessary.
        From a roleplaying
        standpoint, travellers are
        excellent characters for
        campaigns which feature
        exploration rather than pure dungeon
        delving. It will be difficult, if not
        impossible, to justify the inclusion of a
        traveller in a campaign which is intended to remain
        within the confines of a single city as it is a rare
        traveller indeed who can suppress his need to journey
        for that long.
        Adventuring: Travellers are enthusiastic explorers,
        utterly fearless when it comes to plunging into the
        wildest depths and the most dangerous lands. This
        makes them boon companions to those adventuring
        18
        CHARACTER CONCEPTS
        bands which prowl the edges of civilisation, as they
        have a tireless thirst for discovery – travellers are
        kindred spirits to barbarians, bards and especially
        rangers in this respect.
        In general, travellers have no interest in adventures
        that do not involve travel, or at least they have no
        interest in long adventures that do not involve travel. So while a traveller will stay in a town long enough
        for he and his companions to rescue a merchant’s
        daughter from a rogue’s guild, for example, he will
        have no interest in staying long enough to clean up
        the corruption in the town.
        At high levels, when they gain enough experience with
        chaos magic to allow them to easily cast dimension
        spanning enchantments, travellers will begin to yearn
        to see what all the myriad planes have to offer. At this
        point, they will be best served with adventures which
        test the limits of their Movement-based effects;
        hit and run missions into the Abyss, quests across
        the ethereal planes, or, best of all, expeditions into
        shadowy underworlds as yet unexplored. These, and
        similar, adventures will be ideal for chaos mages with
        the traveller concept.
        Benefits: Travellers have a natural understanding
        of chaos’ ability to supersede the laws of space and
        time, giving them unparalleled ability to manipulate
        it themselves. This provides the traveller with several
        bonuses.
        First, they gain a +2 bonus to all final casting
        DC checks when casting a spell which is solely a
        Movement-based effect, or which has Movement as
        its primary effect (see the Chaos Sorcery chapter for
        full details).
        Second, should the traveller fail a final casting DC
        check when attempting to cast a spell which is solely
        a Movement-based effect, or which has Movement
        as its primary effect, he suffers nonlethal, rather than
        lethal damage. The exception to this is when a ‘1’ is rolled, in which case backlash and lethal damage
        occur normally.
        Penalties: Travellers fear being chained and
        controlled above all else, to the point where they find
        it difficult to impose control on others. Their magic
        reflects this fear. It is difficult, but by no means
        impossible, for a traveller to use Domination-based
        effects in his chaos magic.
        A chaos mage traveller suffers a -2 penalty to all
        final casting DC checks when casting a spell which
        is solely a Domination-based effect, or which has
        Domination as its primary effect element. Further,
        they suffer lethal rather than nonlethal damage when
        casting Domination effects, even with a successful
        caster check.
        In the case of spells which combine Movement
        and Domination effects, the bonuses and penalties
        to caster checks cancel one another, meaning the
        traveller makes caster checks with no bonus and
        no penalty. Damage is applied normally, namely
        nonlethal for successful caster checks and lethal for
        failures.
        The Wildling
        What is the nature of chaos? Does it know desire?
        Who created chaos, or is chaos the creator of all else?
        If the power of chaos is unleashed too frequently,
        will it corrupt static reality? Philosophically inclined
        chaos mages wrestle eternally with these important
        questions; if the wildling ever gave them a moment’s
        thought, none would be more surprised than he.
        The wildling is a sort of magical savant, a mortal
        gifted, seemingly randomly, with the ability to wield
        raw chaos energy as he so chooses. The strange
        energy which courses through him is as much a part
        of him as his hands are, and he uses it with no more
        concern.
        Roleplaying: The wildling is a character who wields
        the raw power of chaos with the same ease with
        which he draws breath and with no more thought to
        the consequences. To the wildling, chaos is a tool,
        and tools are meant to be used, especially when
        said tool can do almost anything you put your mind
        to. For the wildling, a rumbling stomach is reason
        enough to use chaos magic; desire for a shiny bauble
        is reason enough; tired feet is reason enough; and
        the threat of pain is certainly reason enough. This
        is not to imply that wildlings do not understand the
        potential consequences of heavy magic use, they do,
        they simply consider them an acceptable risk.
        Why Play a Wildling?: Wildlings are good fits for
        those players who enjoy playing characters who are
        born different, whose innate abilities separate them
        from other mortals and ensure that their lives, one
        way or another, will not be ordinary. Characters
        19
        CHARACTER CONCEPTS
        of this type are currently very popular in fantasy
        fiction and the wildling is a good vehicle for acting
        out adventures similar to those undertaken by the
        protagonists of these popular works.
        Adventuring: Most wildlings adventure because
        they feel they were born to pursue that particular
        vocation – and perhaps they are right. With their
        unique blend of innate power and blissful unconcern
        for the danger inherent in that power, wildlings have
        a powerful advantage over other adventurers, even
        other spellcasters.
        Wildlings work well in adventuring parties,
        particularly if they are the sole, or primary, arcane
        spellcaster. They share the flexibility of all chaos
        mages and couple that with an innate resistance to
        its negative effects. Like their spellcasting brethren,
        wizards and sorcerers, wildling chaos mages are
        relatively fragile in melee combat, meaning they
        have strong incentive to work with fighters and
        other melee-focused characters. That said, they
        share all the chaos mage’s distaste for ‘stuffy’ types, so they are likely to seek out the company
        of rangers, fighters and barbarians, rather than
        paladins or monks. The average wildling gets
        on famously with rogues and since his powers
        can so easily bolster and supplement the
        rogue’s skills, they make an excellent team.
        There is no particular type of adventure that
        defines the wildling character, as they have
        nothing more in common with one another
        than the accident of their birth. From a
        thematic standpoint, wildling characters
        are well suited to campaigns of personal
        exploration or fulfilment of ‘destinies’ – are the wildling’s gifts truly an accident
        of birth, or is there some greater purpose he
        must fulfil, a wrong to be righted, a great evil
        to be slain, a world-wide spiritual awakening to
        be sparked?
        Benefits: The wildling has been exposed to chaos
        energy from birth, and as such, he is more resistant to
        its effects than most. A wildling character does not
        suffer as much damage when casting spells as other
        chaos mages; he takes 1 point of damage for every
        6 points in each spell’s final casting DC, rather than
        1 for every 5 (see the Chaos Sorcery chapter for full
        details). Further, the damage a chaos mage suffers
        during a failed casting check is only half lethal and
        half nonlethal, rather than fully lethal damage. The
        exception to this is when a ‘1’ is rolled, in which case
        backlash and lethal damage occur normally.
        Penalties: Chaos is a part of a wildling, and they
        cannot ever fully divest themselves with it. A
        wildling character begins play with a single step
        on the Path of Chaos of his choice. From that point
        on, the wildling gains and loses steps upon the path
        as normal, with two exceptions – firstly, he cannot
        divest himself of the first step on his Path of Chaos,
        ever. It will remain with him for the remainder of his
        life. Secondly, if he gains a locked step on his Path of
        Chaos, he may never purge that step.
        20
        CHARACTER CONCEPTS
        Chaos Magic and the
        Non-Human Races
        Chaos magic is largely the province of the human
        race, with its hunger to change the world, constant
        need to transform and invent, and intense, conflicting
        passions. The vast majority of chaos mages, perhaps
        seven in ten, are human – and the most powerful
        chaos mages as well, since only humans seem truly
        willing to twist and mutilate their bodies in return for
        magical power.
        This is not to say that there are no chaos mages of
        other races. There have been notable chaos mages
        of all races; they simply are not as common as their
        human counterparts.
        The Existing Concepts and Nonhuman
        Characters
        The role of the aforementioned concepts within each
        nonhuman culture is explored below. While chaos
        mages from any race are permitted to take any of the
        previously listed concepts, it is recommended that the
        players strongly consider selecting those concepts
        which are deemed most appropriate for members of
        that race.
        Elves
        Haughty, majestic and highly magical, elves are
        the longest lived of the humanoid races. Though,
        or perhaps because, they command great mystical
        power, elves only very rarely choose to walk the Paths
        of Chaos. There are several reasons for this, chief
        among them simple fear; chaos taints and irrevocably
        changes everything it touches and precious few
        elves relish the idea of spending the better part of a
        millennium in the form of a boneless blob of flesh, or
        lost in a madness of excruciating sensation. For this,
        and for other reasons, elven society tends to scorn
        and reject those who choose to give themselves to the
        magic of chaos.
        What all this means is that those few elves who do
        become chaos mages are exceptionally reckless
        and daring, by both human and elven standards. Sometimes confident to the point of arrogance,
        sometimes fatalistic, they are never afraid of the
        consequences of using chaos – this does not mean
        they actively court the devastation of mind and body
        that chaos can wreak, simply that they do not shirk
        away from it.
        Elven culture prizes creativity above all else and
        elven chaos mages hold true to this belief. By far
        the most common character concept for elven chaos
        mages is the maker. Elven makers highly prize the
        art of illusion and often add minor illusion effects
        to their spells simply because it is aesthetically
        pleasing. Though elven makers still do not enjoy the
        prestige that elven sorcerers do, they come the closest
        of all chaos mages to being accepted by elven society
        as a whole.
        Elven chaos sculptors are also relatively common and
        there is perhaps one sculptor for every three makers
        in elven lands. In fact, chaos sculptors and makers
        often work together, both because their powers
        complement one another and because they can find
        total acceptance only in the presence of their peers.
        The other concepts (masters, travellers, breakers
        and wildlings) are not unknown in elven society, but
        they are certainly rare. Breakers occasionally find
        some measure of fame serving as heavy support for
        elven border patrols, and masters are (albeit rarely)
        employed as diplomats. Those elves who take up
        the mantle of travellers rarely remain within elven
        society for long, as most put pack to shoulder in seek
        of more tolerant lands as soon as they are able.
        Gnomes
        With their innate understanding of esoteric scientific
        concepts and their naturalistic, somewhat chaotic
        mindset, gnomes make exceptional chaos mages. Unlike so many other races, the gnomes hold no
        prejudices against those who practice the chaos
        arts, and indeed, embrace those who weave chaos
        elements with skill and daring. Chaos mages are
        considered to be scientists and explorers, dreamers
        and leaders. The greatest chaos mages are mentioned
        in the same breath as the greatest gnomish sorcerers,
        wizards and leaders, and young gnomes often seek
        to apprentice themselves to chaos mages if the
        opportunity presents itself.
        Sculptors are by far the most common gnomish chaos
        mages, as the ability to accomplish great alchemical
        feats by sheer force of will is highly regarded. Gnome sculptors are national heroes, wandering from
        gnomish village to gnomish city, using their abilities
        to teach, defend and enhance the quality of life.
        21
        CHARACTER CONCEPTS
        Makers are also common in gnome society, focusing
        most commonly on illusion magic. Gnomish illusions
        are uniformly complex and whimsical, overblown
        fancies which are only rarely intended to accurately
        replicate real objects. The greatest gnome makers
        work their magics in the courts of kings and are
        considered to be invaluable for maintaining both the
        good humour and the humility of the royal families.
        As might be expected, breakers are very rare in gnome
        society, since gnomes prefer non-violent solutions
        to problems. Those few gnome breakers generally
        take it upon themselves to remain separate from
        gnome society, until such time as their unparalleled
        destructive abilities are needed. Breakers are the
        gnome chaos mages most likely to actively seek
        out adventure, and they frequently leave the relative
        tranquillity of gnomish lands far behind them.
        Half-elves
        Shunned by both human and elf society, half-elves are
        wanderers and loners, drifting through the wilderness
        like ghosts, or settling down in the outskirts of
        frontier towns, places where their outcast heritage
        matters less than their skill and daring.
        Half-elf chaos mages are relatively common, as the
        idea of using nothing more than force of will to
        affect great change in the world is very appealing to
        those who quite often have nothing. Though many
        are loathe to admit it, the thought that chaos magic
        might, however briefly, allow them to transcend their
        mixed heritage and become something more is quite
        appealing as well.
        The majority of half-elf chaos mages are travellers,
        using their command of Movement effects to explore
        the hidden recesses of the world and amassing power
        and experience thereby.
        Half-elf masters are common as well, most using
        their ability to control and influence minds to force
        the respect and acceptance they want onto every
        being they come across. The worst masters are like
        rabid dogs, striking out with fury and vengeance until
        they are laid low by sword, axe or spell.
        Half-orcs
        Misunderstood, frequently hunted both by human
        and orc clans, and cursed to live a shadowy existence
        on society’s fringe, the typical half-orc has nothing to
        lose. No wonder, then, that so many half-orcs pursue
        the ways of the chaos mage. Though it cannot be
        said that half-orc chaos mages are common, they are
        more numerous than half-orc wizards and sorcerers,
        and potentially more powerful – while the dull wits
        and thuggish temperament that are a legacy of their
        orc ancestry hampers those half-orcs who wish to
        become wizards or sorcerers, it has no effect on their
        ability to master chaos magic.
        The most common half-orc chaos mages are,
        unsurprisingly, breakers. The ruthlessness that most
        half-orcs have beaten into them early in life makes
        them exceptionally dangerous and half-orc breakers
        are rightly feared for their relentless ferocity in battle. Half-orc breakers often seize slums or wildlands for
        their own, declare themselves warlords and settle
        down to rule ‘their’ territory, killing any and all
        who would stand in their way. Others take it upon
        themselves to protect other half-orcs and to a lesser
        extent the poor and downtrodden in general, though
        breakers of this sort are few in number.
        Half-orc masters are surprisingly common. Though
        most half-orcs lack the subtlety and, frankly, the wits
        to survive long as behind the scenes masterminds,
        their intense desire to have some measure of control
        and authority in the world sometimes unconsciously
        guides them down the master’s path.
        Half-orc travellers are also good character choices,
        as the idea of half-orcs being especially good at
        wandering or escaping persecution is thematically
        appropriate.
        Halflings
        There are very few halfling chaos mages, for the
        people of that race have a natural suspicion of
        supernatural forces which can so completely and
        irrevocably alter the mortal form. Still, chaos mages
        are not unheard of in halfling society and they are
        generally tolerated, if eyed with the same suspicion
        one gives to a half-trained wolf.
        By far the largest percentage of halfling chaos
        mages are travellers. This is understandable, as
        halflings have a near insatiable hunger for travel
        and exploration. Halfling travellers are learned in
        all matters of geography, both earthly and planar,
        and are enthusiastic collectors of new experiences. Halfling travellers often serve as caravan guides or
        22
        CHARACTER CONCEPTS
        leaders, since they have both the experience and the
        raw power necessary to lead the enormous national
        caravans.
        Those halfling travellers who choose to become
        adventurers are often revered as folk heroes, their
        exploits told round campfires with great relish;
        typically, their stories are filled with puns and
        outright exaggerations and almost invariably end
        with outrageous, often scandalous, punch lines.
        Halfling breakers are surprisingly common and
        often find employ as guardians of national caravans,
        where their destructive abilities are put to good use
        protecting wagons and rolling citadels from the
        depredations of bandits, rogue monsters and other,
        darker things.
        Halfling dominators are almost unheard of, as
        halflings think poorly, to put it mildly, of those who
        would usurp the will of another. Those halflings
        who do manifest the master’s talents, and the
        corresponding mindset, rarely stay in the national
        caravans long enough to rouse suspicion; instead,
        they disappear as quickly as possible into the first
        large town the caravan passes by, there to work
        magic on the unsuspecting populace, or to seek out
        opportunities for adventure, as their moral compass
        guides them.
        Dwarves
        Doughty, stout-hearted, dependable, obsessed with
        honour and with the fulfilment of obligation, skilled
        craftsmen and exacting taskmasters, the dwarves
        are all these things and more. They are known and
        respected, even by their enemies, for their courage
        and for their skill with steel, gem, and stone.
        What they are not known for is recklessness,
        irresponsibility or adaptability. Stone is rigid and
        inflexible and so it is for dwarves. Or, it more correct
        to say, most dwarves.
        By far the vast majority of dwarves are lawful in
        alignment, meaning that dwarf society is structured
        and fairly rigid in its thinking. Some small percentage
        of dwarves, however, hold to a different set of beliefs;
        rejecting their society’s strict adherence to tradition
        and obedience to the clan and to the dwarven nation,
        they hew their own shaft, holding true to the notion
        of personal freedom, of flexibility, of choice. Some
        small number of these become chaos mages.
        Makers and sculptors are common among dwarven
        chaos mages, as one might well imagine. Both types
        of chaos mage can and do find acclaim and respect in
        dwarven society, should they not simply leave their
        clan hold at the earliest opportunity, though the non-
        permanent nature of the constructs they create and
        changes they bring is taken as a sign that the forge
        god’s favour lies with those who use the traditional
        methods of forge, hammer and pick.
        Breakers are also relatively common in the ranks of
        dwarf chaos mages, with most serving in the dwarven
        armies, voyaging far under the earth to bring their
        spells to bear against the monstrous beasts who writhe
        in the darkness. Dwarf breakers are especially fond
        of fire, and rarely if ever cast chaos spells which are
        not modified to use one of the traditional elements.
        Travellers are exceedingly rare in dwarf society,
        though those few who choose (or are chosen for) this
        path are good candidates for adventurer characters. Those who do not join adventuring bands often
        venture alone into the deep darkness of the earth,
        there to seek fortune and revel in the joy of discovery
        – most end up dead, in some forgotten corner of the
        eternal night, but some gain experience enough to
        cast spells which carry them to other dimensions.
        The Living Forge
        The living forge embodies the fire of creativity that
        burns in the heart of all dwarves. Though their magic
        is seen as alien and frightening, they are revered as
        master craftsmen whose talents were quickened,
        stoked and shaped on the forge of the dwarven All
        Father. Living forge chaos mages live and work
        alongside the greatest dwarven smiths and smith-
        priests, using their magic to create mighty works
        that inspire the dwarven people to greater creative
        heights.
        Roleplaying: Living forges know their place and
        their worth in the community. Having been accorded
        great respect from birth, they are accustomed to being
        given deference in all things, reacting poorly to those
        who consider themselves to be their equals. They do,
        however, greatly respect those skilled in the arts of
        the smith, or the mason, or the jeweller, and have a
        grudging respect for warriors of all sorts.
        Why Play a Living Forge?: The living forge is
        a great character for a player who wished to be a
        23
        CHARACTER CONCEPTS
        dwarf, but isn’t comfortable playing dour characters. The living forge is also an excellent choice for those
        who are fond of the archetypal dwarven smith, but
        understand the difficulties of hauling a forge and
        tools on country-spanning adventures.
        Adventuring: Those living forges who choose
        to adventure typically do so to gain a better
        understanding of the forge skills of other races, or to
        pursue lost artefacts of dwarven design. Occasionally,
        they will adventure to find rare materials for the forge,
        or simply to obtain experience using their abilities in
        battle and other stressful situations.
        Living forges get along well with warriors of all sorts,
        though they have a particular fondness
        for fighters and paladins, who often
        wear heavy arms and armour and
        who usually appreciate the strength
        of dwarven forge work. Unlike other
        chaos mages, living forges do not enjoy
        the company of more larcenous rogues
        and bards; though they appreciate their
        skills and at least understand their
        carefree ways, they are distrustful and
        resentful of those who would deprive
        them of their wealth and creations.
        In the party, living forges operate
        behind the front lines, strengthening
        swords and armour and gifting their
        companions with skin as hard as
        stone.
        Benefits: Living forges have a knack
        for using Materialisation effects, and
        for extending the length of chaos
        magic spells with Materialisation and
        transformation effects.
        When casting a spell which
        includes Materialisation effects or
        Transformation effects, reduce the
        casting DC of the duration element
        by 5 (to below 0, if applicable). This
        means that living forges can attach a
        By Round duration element (DC + 5)
        to a Materialisation or Transformation
        spell without increasing the final
        casting DC. This can even lower the
        final casting DC by using a single
        round duration element (DC + 2, modified to -3) or
        instantaneous duration element (DC + 0, modified to
        -5).
        Penalties: While living forges are exceptional
        creators and sculptors, they have little ability in
        wreaking magical havoc or affecting the minds of
        others. Living forges must add one and one half
        times the normal base casting DC when adding Direct
        Damage or Domination effects to their spells. For
        example, a Raw Damage effect would be considered
        to have a base DC of 15, rather than 10, when used
        by a living forge.

        To learn the way of the bloodcarver is to learn the
        way of pain and suffering. Our body is the land,
        magic the river which flows through it and our
        injuries the channels through which the river flows. The deeper the channel, the mightier the river. The
        stronger the magic.
        Such is our way. Let the bloodriver swell. The chaos mage character is already blessed
        with near matchless versatility as a spellcaster,
        but while this serves to differentiate him from
        other arcane casters, it does nothing to distinguish
        him from his chaos wielding peers. Further, as has
        already been demonstrated in the Character Concepts
        chapter, no two chaos mages approach chaos sorcery
        in the same way. The prestige classes which follow
        address both these issues and allow players and
        Games Masters alike to better differentiate the many
        types of chaos mage.
        The prestige classes presented in this chapter are by
        no means the only possible prestige class choices for
        chaos mages, merely some of the most common.
        Bloodcarver
        Pure chaos energy flows through the veins of the
        bloodcarver, sustaining him and driving him onward. By releasing his chaos blood to dissipate in the open
        air, the bloodcarver can gain great power over reality. This is not without cost, however, as this primitive
        method of spellcasting inflicts hideous damage upon
        those who practice it. But what is a little pain, what is
        a little disfigurement, what is a little bloodshed, in the
        face of unlimited mastery of primal chaos?
        Hit die: d6
        Requirements
        In order to qualify to become a bloodcarver, the
        character must fulfil all the following requirements:
        Feats: Great Fortitude or Toughness
        Skills: Concentration 9 ranks
        Spellcasting: The ability to cast chaos magic spells
        Class Skills
        The bloodcarver’s class skills, and the relevant
        ability for each skill, are: Bluff (Cha), Concentration
        (Con), Craft (alchemy) (Int), Heal (Wis), Knowledge
        (arcana) (Int), Profession (Wis) and Spellcraft (Int).
        Skill Points Per Level: 2 + Int modifier
        Class Features
        All the following are class features of the bloodcarver
        prestige class.
        Spellcasting: The character continues to improve in
        spellcasting, gaining a new chaos caster level at every
        level except 3rd and 9th. These level increases are not
        taken into account for the purposes of determining
        access to Chaos Countermagic, increases to the
        number of Multiple Effects or increasing the ability
        scores of familiars.
        Weapon and Armour Proficiency: Bloodcarvers
        gain no new proficiencies in any weapons or armour.
        Bloodletting (Su): At 1st level, the bloodcarver learns
        how to release chaos energy by spilling his own blood. Providing a quick route for the chaos to leave makes
        it easier for the mage to fashion his spells, but the
        damage inflicted can be quite horrific. For each two
        points of damage the mage causes to himself while
        casting a spell allows him a +1 circumstance bonus
        to the casting check, to a maximum of his Wisdom
        bonus plus one half his bloodcarver level. This
        damage is independent of the nonlethal or normal
        damage caused by the spell’s actual casting. The
        damage caused by bloodletting can only be healed by
        rest – magic of any sort has no effect, though natural
        regeneration or fast healing are effective.
        Ignore Pain (Ex): Bloodcarvers quickly learn to
        distance themselves from their pain, the better to
        protect themselves from the horrors they inflict on
        their own bodies. At 2nd level, the bloodcarver is so
        resistant to pain that he gains a +1 competence bonus
        per bloodcarver level to all Concentration checks,
        but only when those checks involve ignoring pain
        or damage. So, this bonus applies to saves made to
        successfully maintain a spell when struck in combat,
        but not when the mage must attempt to maintain his
        Concentration in the face of hurricane winds.

        10 +5 +7 +3+7DR 5/lawful, Steal Blood +1 caster level
        Armour Of Scars (Ex): The bloodcarver’s unique
        abilities are very unforgiving to mortal flesh and so
        he quickly finds himself covered in a web of thick
        scar tissue. The primal force of chaos hardens this
        deformed, puckered crimson skin, transforming
        it into armour of sorts. Beginning at 3rd level, the
        bloodcarver gains a +1 natural armour bonus. At 6th
        level, the bonus increases to +2, and again at 9th level
        to +3.
        Damage Reduction (Ex): Chaos preserves its own. The bloodcarver is capable of shrugging off damage
        which would kill normal men, as the power of his
        chaos magic works to turn aside blades, slow the
        impact of arrows and blunt the crushing blow of
        hammers and fists alike. At 4th level, the character
        gains DR 2/lawful. At 6th level, the bloodcarver’s
        damage reduction increases to 3/lawful, at 8th to 4/
        lawful and at 10th level to 5/lawful.
        Bloodcarving: At 5th level, the chaos mage perfects
        the art of releasing chaos through pain and blood. This ability allows the chaos mage to carve his
        flesh more precisely, so less damage need be dealt
        for him to achieve the desired result when casting a
        spell. For every 1 point of damage the bloodcarver
        causes to himself while casting a spell, he gains a
        +1 circumstance bonus to his casting check, to a
        maximum bonus equal to his Wisdom modifier + one
        half his bloodcarver level.
        Steal Blood (Su): At 10th level, the bloodcarver
        learns the secret of using the blood of others to
        fuel his enchantments. Once a day per bloodcarver
        level the mage can absorb the lifeblood of others,
        by striking them successfully in melee combat with
        a slashing or piercing weapon. He must declare that
        he is using this ability before he attacks and a failed
        attack roll does not count against his total uses of this
        ability. If he successfully strikes, he may add a +1
        circumstance bonus per point of damage inflicted
        to the next casting check he makes, so long as that
        casting is made in the round immediately following
        the successful use of this ability. The bloodcarver can
        gain a maximum bonus equal to his Wisdom bonus
        + one half his bloodcarver level. This ability cannot
        be used against undead, plants, constructs, or against
        any other creature which does not bleed.
        Chaotic Fist
        While most chaos mages are content to channel
        their chaotic energies into spells, the chaotic fist
        has adapted the flows of chaos into a martial art. Coupling the unpredictable nature of chaos with
        his personal strength, the chaotic fist is capable of
        unleashing a terrific flurry of attacks in a very short
        time span.
        As an answer to the monk’s steadfast discipline
        and ordered mind, the chaotic fist sees the world
        as a kaleidoscope of sensations and frozen instants
        of time. During combat, he is able to perceive and
        react to unpredictable events at an alarming rate,
        as the flows of chaos move him through the battle. The random nature of this style makes it difficult to
        defend against, and the raw warping power of chaos
        creates a potent weapon indeed.

        In order to become a chaotic fist, the character must
        fulfil all the following requirements:
        Feats: Improved Initiative, Improved Unarmed
        Strike
        Skills: Concentration 8 ranks, Jump 6 ranks

        Class Skills
        The chaotic fist’s class skills and the relevant ability

        Concentration (Con), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate
        (Cha), Jump (Str), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str) and
        Tumble (Dex).
        Skill Points Per Level: 2 + Int modifier
        Class Features
        All of the following are class features of the chaotic
        fist prestige class.
        Weapon and Armour Proficiency: Chaotic fists
        gain no proficiency in any weapon or armour upon
        taking a level of this prestige class. In addition,
        wearing any armour at all inhibits the chaotic fist’s
        ability to move with the flows of chaotic energy and
        prevents them from using any of the special abilities
        of this prestige class while the armour is worn.
        Spellcasting: The character continues to improve in
        spellcasting, gaining a new chaos caster level at 3rd,
        6th and 9th levels. These level increases are not taken
        into account for the purposes of determining access
        to Chaos Countermagic, increases to the number of
        Multiple Effects or increasing the ability scores of
        familiars.
        Chaos Touch: The raw chaos coursing through the
        body of the chaotic fist increases the damage of any
        unarmed attack he makes. This ability adds 1d4
        hit points of anarchic damage to all the character’s
        unarmed attacks, plus one additional hit point of
        anarchic damage per chaotic fist class level.
        Armour Of Chaos: When this ability is gained, the
        chaotic fist’s body becomes suffused with chaotic
        energy that allows him to avoid blows easier than
        most. The chaotic fist receives a +4 natural armour
        bonus as long as he is not wearing any other armour.
        Chaotic Surge: By calling upon the chaotic energies
        in his body, the chaotic fist is able to increase his
        Strength and Dexterity for a short time, though he
        must pay a dear price for doing so. When activated,
        this ability allows the chaos mage to increase his
        Strength and Dexterity ability scores by up to 5
        points for a number of minutes equal to his current
        chaotic fist + chaos mage levels. When this ability
        ends, however, the character immediately suffers 1d4
        points of temporary ability damage to both Strength
        and Dexterity as the unrestrained flows of chaos rip
        through his flesh. This can temporary damage cannot
        be healed with magic of any type. This ability may be
        used once per day per two chaotic fist levels.
        Chaotic Flesh: The power of chaos begins
        rearranging the body of the chaotic fist, making him
        27
        PRESTIGE CLASSES
        more difficult to damage. The chaotic fist receives
        a +5 natural bonus to his Armour Class (which does
        stack with the bonus provided by Armour of Chaos),
        but this bonus only applies on the confirmation attack
        roll for a critical hit. Though the character is not
        less susceptible to standard damage, it is much more
        difficult to land a critical strike against him.
        Concentrated Chaos: The chaotic fist is able to
        use the power of chaos to bolster his powers of
        concentration. The chaotic fist now receives a natural
        bonus to all Concentration skill checks equal to one-
        half his current chaos fist level, rounded down.
        Flow of Chaos: The chaos mage may take an
        additional 5-foot step before or after each melee
        attack he makes during the round. This step does not
        provoke an attack of opportunity and does not count
        against his normal movement rate for the round.
        Chaotic Warfare: The chaotic fist is able to see the
        flows of chaos through the battlefield and may alter
        them with the power of his will alone. Once this
        ability is gained, the chaotic fist may spend a full-
        round action to assess the state of a given physical
        combat. At the end of this time, he may attempt to
        tweak the lines of chaos to create a more favourable
        situation for himself and his allies. This requires a
        successful Concentration check (15 + the highest
        level or Hit Die of creatures on the opposing side of
        the battle). For every five full points by which this
        Concentration skill check succeeds, the chaotic fist’s
        allies (who are within 30 feet of his current location)
        receive a +1 insight bonus to all attack and damage
        rolls until the combat ends. The chaotic fist also
        immediately suffers 1d4 hit points of damage per
        point of insight bonus granted – the price for playing
        with the forces of chaos.
        Chaotic Specialist
        Wielding the raw power of chaos is an exhilarating
        experience and the flexibility provided by this power
        is envied by static mages the world over. But there
        are those who feel they do not need to access all
        facets of chaotic power, but instead prefer to focus
        their efforts on a particular type of chaos magic. Damage and transformation are the most popular
        forms of specialisation, but any effect can be the
        focus of specialisation.
        While they are able to conjure more powerful chaos
        effects in their area of expertise, specialists suffer
        shortfalls with other effect elements. Given the
        dangers of chaos magic, however, there are those
        who find the trade-off beneficial – by focusing on
        their area of expertise, they are less likely to suffer a
        chaotic backlash and find it easier to shed their steps
        on a chosen Path of Chaos.
        Hit die: 1d4
        Requirements
        In order to become a chaotic specialist, the character
        must fulfil all the following requirements:
        Feats: Alertness, Casting Focus, Combat Casting
        Skills: Concentration 10 ranks
        Spellcasting: The ability to cast chaos magic
        Class Skills
        The chaotic specialist’s class skills, and the key
        ability for each skill, are: Concentration (Con),
        Craft (alchemy) (Int), Knowledge (arcana) (Int),
        Profession (Wis), Search (Int), Speak Language
        (None), Spellcraft (Int) and Spot (Wis).
        Skill Points Per Level: 2 + Intelligence modifier
        Class Features
        All of the following are class features of the chaotic
        specialist prestige class.
        Weapon and Armour Proficiency: Chaotic
        specialists gain no proficiency in any weapon or
        armour upon taking a level of this prestige class.
        Spellcasting: The character continues to improve
        in spellcasting, gaining a new chaos caster level
        at 1rd level and then every other level. These level
        increases are not taken into account for the purposes
        of determining access to Chaos Countermagic,
        increases to the number of Multiple Effects or
        increasing the ability scores of familiars.
        Attuned: The chaos mage must select his
        speciality effect (from Direct Damage, Domination,
        Materialisation, Movement or Transformation), as
        soon as he takes his first level of the chaotic specialist
        prestige class. Only one attuned effect may ever
        be chosen. The mage is now always able to cast
        a spell with this effect included, in addition to the
        usual number of multiple effects a chaos mage is
        allowed. Thus a 9th level chaos mage can cast a

        chaos mage/1rd level chaotic specialist may create
        weaves with three effects, as long as one effect is his
        specialist subject.
        Increased Affinity: Whenever the specialist gains a
        level of chaos mage spellcasting ability (either from
        chaos mage levels or levels of this prestige class) he
        also gains a +1 insight bonus to any casting checks
        he makes when constructing a spell weave containing
        his attuned effect.
        Purge: When this ability is gained, the chaotic
        specialist may immediately purge himself of one step
        on his current Path of Chaos. His concentration has
        paid off and he can reverse the ravening effects of
        chaos on his body – but only once.
        Reduced Casting Damage: When this ability is cast,
        the specialist suffers one hit point less of nonlethal
        or lethal damage when casting spells containing his
        specialised effect. However, the final casting DCs of
        all spells that do not contain this effect element are
        now increased by 5.
        Chaotic Burst: When this ability is used, the
        specialist may reduce the final casting DC of any
        single spell containing his specialised effect by 5. This reduction comes with a price however – the
        caster immediately suffers one point of temporary
        damage to one of his physical abilities upon casting
        one of these spells. The ability score damage is
        applied randomly to the physical attributes every
        time a spell is cast. This damage may not be healed
        magically.
        Chaotic Core: The specialist has achieved a state
        of knowledge about his current specialisation that a
        generalist can never hope to achieve. By suffering
        successful casting damage as real hit points of
        damage rather than as nonlethal damage, the chaos
        mage is able to reduce the DC of any spell he casts
        that contain his specialised effect element by 5. This
        reduction stacks with that gained from Chaotic Burst,
        but if it is used in this way the damage from Chaotic
        Burst doubles. The DC modifiers of all effects that
        are not his specialisation are increased by +1 DC,
        on top of any penalties accrued by previous chaotic
        specialist class features.
        Doomringer
        The doomringer cult was founded after study in both
        the fields of necromantic and chaos magic revealed
        the possibility of forging a bond between the living
        and the dead and, furthermore, that the bond could be
        used to shift the lash of chaos from one to the other.
        The name of the cult comes from the fact that the
        doomringers used tiny, enchanted copper bells to
        forge the connection between the living and the dead. When spellcasting or inflicted damage would affect
        the doomringer, his bell begins to toll, echoed by the
        corpse’s.
        Though the use of the dead in this fashion is not
        innately evil, the forced agony suffered by the
        corpse’s spirit is. In order for the bonding to take
        effect, the corpse used must be from the recently
        deceased. The act of creating the bond imprisons the
        deceased’s spirit, subjecting it to terrible agony each
        time damage is transferred to its mortal shell. When

        character must fulfil all the following requirements:
        Feats: Endurance
        Skills: Concentration 9 ranks, Knowledge (arcana)

        (alchemy, coppersmith) (Int), Knowledge (arcana)
        (Int), Sense Motive (Wis) and Spellcraft (Int).
        Skill Points Per Level: 2 + Int modifier
        Class Features
        All the following are class features of the doomringer
        prestige class.
        Spellcasting: The character continues to improve in
        spellcasting, gaining a new chaos caster level at every
        level except 3rd and 9th. These level increases are not
        taken into account for the purposes of determining
        access to Chaos Countermagic, Multiple Effect
        increases or ability score increases for familiars.
        Weapon and Armour Proficiency: Doomringers
        gain no new proficiencies in any weapons or armour.
        Corpse Pact (Su): Upon taking the first level of
        the doomringer prestige class, the character learns
        the secret of making a corpse pact. This requires
        enchanting a pair of copper bells with the mixed blood
        of the doomringer and the corpse, then infusing both
        bells with a rush of chaos in a ritual which lasts 1d4
        hours. The ritual forms a link between the doomringer
        and the corpse, which allows the doomringer to avoid
        much of the damage that would normally be caused
        by manipulating chaos magic. Only one corpse may
        be bonded in this way at any time.
        Any time the doomringer would suffer damage from a
        casting attempt, one half of the damage is transferred
        to the corpse instead. This bonded corpse has a
        number of hit points equal to 1d4 per doomringer
        level of the caster at the time the bond was created. If the doomringer later gains a doomringer level,
        the corpse does not gain more hit points. Hit points
        applied to a corpse are always considered lethal,
        even if the shunted damage was nonlethal. Once
        a corpse’s hit points are depleted, it is destroyed,
        leaving nothing but a foul-smelling stain.
        The bells both the doomringer and the corpse wear
        emit a spectral ringing that lasts for 1 round per point
        of damage the corpse suffers. The bell can be heard
        by anyone within a 50 feet radius and cannot be
        silenced by any means, magical or otherwise.
        30
        PRESTIGE CLASSES
        A corpse may be attacked as per the normal rules for
        attacking inanimate objects, taking damage on the
        hit points the doomringer has invested into it. The
        doomringer must be within his doomringer level in
        miles of the corpse in order for his corpse pact to be
        effective (otherwise the corpse crumbles when the
        doomringer leaves the designated area). There is
        nothing to stop a doomringer travelling with a corpse,
        however (apart from the rumours) Once a corpse
        has been destroyed, the doomringer suffers double
        damage from spellcasting until such time as a new
        corpse has been bonded.
        Preserve Corpse (Su): At 3rd level, the doomringer
        gains enough necromantic knowledge to begin
        repairing damage dealt to his bonded corpse. Once
        per day, the chaos mage can restore 1d6 points of
        damage to the corpse, by infusing a bit of his life
        essence into the corpse. This does not harm the
        doomringer in any fashion. Preserve corpse is a
        supernatural ability which requires a full round action
        in the presence of the corpse.
        Blood Shunt (Su): At 4th level, the doomringer learns
        how to shunt not just damage from spellcasting, but
        from injury, to his bonded corpse. He can transfer
        1 hit point of damage to the corpse for every 4
        hit points of damage he suffers. He must decide
        immediately upon suffering the attack whether or not
        to transfer the damage to the corpse. Blood shunt is
        a supernatural ability which can be activated as a free
        action.
        Walking Death (Su): The doomringer can now
        forestall his own death by drawing upon the spirit
        within his bonded corpse. If a doomringer falls below
        0 hit points, but is not yet at -10, the imprisoned spirit
        allows him to remain conscious, at least to a limited
        degree. While using this ability, the doomringer is
        limited to taking partial actions only each round.
        Each round the doomringer remains conscious at
        negative hit points, his bonded corpse suffers 1d4
        points of damage – if it is destroyed while used in this
        manner, the doomringer immediately dies. Walking
        death is a supernatural ability which can be activated
        as a free action.
        String Of Bells (Su): The doomringer’s bonding
        abilities are such that he may link more than a
        single corpse to his spirit. Additional corpses up to
        the character’s Wisdom modifier (minimum of one
        extra corpse) may now be enchanted with a corpse
        pact, though to a lesser extent – these additional
        corpses have only the character’s doomringer level
        + Constitution modifier in hit points each. In every
        other respect they are treated like normal corpse pact
        victims.
        Avatar Of Death (Su): The doomringer has now
        mastered the corpse bond, allowing him to more
        efficiently channel damage done to him through his
        chaos bond. He may transfer all damage suffered
        from chaos spellcasting to his bonded corpse and one
        half of any damage suffered from injury. Avatar of
        death is a supernatural ability which can be activated
        as a free action.
        The Black Bell (Su): The doomringer’s bond is so
        powerful that he begins to take on limited aspects of
        the dead. The doomringer is rendered immune to the
        effects of critical hits and gains a bonus equal to his
        Wisdom bonus to saves against mind affecting spells
        and spell like effects, poison, sleep effects, paralysis,
        stunning, disease and death effects. These bonuses
        apply only while the doomringer is bonded to a
        corpse. The black bell is a supernatural ability.
        Fractured Jester
        The soul guides. The mind decides. The body acts. That is the way of things.
        The mind is master, the body slave. Act must follow
        decision. That is the way of things.
        But what if there were another way? A way for the
        body to act, to react, without need of thought, without
        need of decision?
        The fractured jester knows this way, this secret way. He preaches the way, and lives the way.
        The way of action without deliberation, without
        decision. The way of limitless possibility.
        The way of chaos.

        Skill Points Per Level: 4 + Int modifier
        Class Features
        All the following are class features of the fractured
        jester prestige class.
        Spellcasting: The character continues to improve in
        spellcasting, gaining a new chaos caster level at every
        level except 3rd and 9th. These level increases are not
        taken into account for the purposes of determining
        access to Chaos Countermagic, increases to the
        number of Multiple Effects or increasing the ability
        scores of familiars.
        Weapon and Armour Proficiency: Fractured jesters
        gain a single proficiency in either longsword, rapier
        or short sword, but gain no proficiencies in any
        armour types or shields.
        Bonus Feat (Ex): The fractured jester is unfettered
        by rational thought; he has no doubts, no fears and
        does not give thought to the consequences of his
        actions until long after he has acted. As such, he
        does not hesitate to act where more thoughtful men
        would be given pause. At 1st level, the fractured jester
        gains a bonus feat from the following list: Acrobatic,
        Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Improved Initiative,
        Mobility, Lightning Reflexes, Skill Focus (any class
        skill) or Stealthy. He gains a 2nd bonus feat from this
        list at 6th level.
        Forced Focus (Su): Fractured jesters gain great
        insight into the nature of the world and of the inherent
        qualities of possibility, but this is not without cost. The fractured jester is incapable of forcing another to
        take any action through the use of magic; since he is
        barely capable of considering his own actions ahead
        of time, he finds it impossible to do so for others. The fractured jester is incapable of using Domination
        effects in his chaos spells and any attempt to do so
        results in an automatic failure and backlash.
        Not Where You Thought I Was (Su): The fractured
        jester does not see the world as other men do. Instead
        of colours, shapes and forms, he sees the possibilities
        of colours, of shapes, of forms and thoughts and
        motions. For the fractured jester, the random actions
        of the world take definitive shape, allowing him to
        determine where his enemies will find the greatest
        possibility of success, and place himself where that
        is not. The fractured jester adds his Wisdom bonus to
        his Armour Class and uses his Wisdom bonus, rather
        than Dexterity, when determining his initiative. The fractured jester also gains a bonus equal to
        his Wisdom modifier to resist any type of scrying
        32
        PRESTIGE CLASSES
        targeted on him. Not where you thought I was is a
        supernatural ability – it is always active under normal
        circumstances, but ceases to function in anti-magic
        fields and other, magically dead areas.
        The Infinite Jest (Su): The fractured jester is a
        trickster unparalleled and his victim is mundane
        reality and all those who muddle through it. Beginning at 4th level, the fractured jester learns to
        trick possibility, to wiggle between strands of success
        and to tie them together like pretty bows, all in the
        name of his own entertainment.
        At 4th level, the fractured jester learns to sidestep
        around the senses and trained skills of those around
        him, ducking strands of success and splashing about
        in puddles of negative outcomes. He adds one half
        his Wisdom modifier to checks with the following
        skills:: Escape Artist, Hide, Move Silently, Sleight of
        Hand and Tumble.
        At 8th level, the fractured jester learns to place his
        weapons just so, to slide them between the strands
        of possibility which determine that he must fail,
        and strike true. He can substitute half his Wisdom
        modifier for his Strength modifier when making
        attack rolls with a melee weapon. Half his Wisdom
        modifier is also added to his Reflex saves.
        At 10th level, the fractured jester need no longer duck
        and weave to avoid those strands of possibility which
        do not favour him. Instead,
        having shamed reality
        with his daring and wit,
        he simply acts as he will,
        unimpeded by emasculated
        mundanity. He adds his
        full Wisdom modifier to
        Escape Artist, Hide, Move
        Silently, Sleight of Hand,
        and Tumble checks and
        his full Wisdom modifier
        to attack rolls and Reflex
        saves.
        Lord of
        Change
        Chaos mages are drifters
        and restless wanderers,
        dreamers and visionaries
        and destroyers. The
        common folk fear chaos mages, and with good
        reason, for upheaval follows in their wake and chaos
        spirits herald their arrival like vultures seeking the
        feast.
        Perhaps no chaos mage fits this description better
        than the lord of change. He is cloaked in possibility
        and all the maybes, mayhaps, perhapses, perchances,
        unlikelies, definitelies and nevers of the world swirl
        about him like autumn leaves.
        Hit die: d4

        Class Features
        All the following are class features of the lord of
        change prestige class.
        Spellcasting: The character continues to improve in
        spellcasting, gaining a new chaos caster level at every
        level except 3rd and 9th. These level increases are not
        taken into account for the purposes of determining
        access to Chaos Countermagic, increases to the
        number of Multiple Effects or increasing the ability
        scores of familiars.
        Weapon and Armour Proficiency: Lords of change
        gain no new proficiencies in any weapons or armour.
        Specialised Focus (Su): At 1st level, the lord of
        change gains great insight into the nature of change
        and transformation. He gains the Specialised Focus
        feat, but must apply it to either Materialisation or
        Transformation effects. He gains the feat again at 5th
        level and must apply it to whichever effect he did not
        select at 1st level.
        Forced Focus (Su): The lord of change is the master
        of evolution and of transformation, and is incapable
        of dominating the minds of others, or directly
        annihilating objects or living beings. Beginning at
        1st level, he no longer has access to Domination or
        Direct Damage effects, and any attempt to use them
        in his chaos casting results in an automatic failure and
        backlash.
        Master Of Evolution (Su): The lord of change is the
        avatar of change and he finds it a simple matter to cast
        spells which have far reaching consequences. At 3rd
        level, select either Materialisation or Transformation
        effects – when casting spells which are composed
        solely of that effect element, the default duration
        is raised to By Round. This means that the lord of
        change does not increase the DC of his spells when
        he chooses a By Round effect. As a consequence of
        this, the DC cost of selecting other Duration elements
        is lowered as shown below:
        Instantaneous (DC -5)
        One Round (DC -2)
        By Round ( Default)
        By Minute (DC + 5)
        By Hour (DC + 10)
        At 7th level, the lord of change gains the same benefit
        when casting spells which are composed solely of
        whichever of the two effect elements he did not
        select at 3rd level. In addition, he can apply the bonus
        to spells which combine both Materialisation and
        Transformation effect elements.
        At 10th level, when casting Materialisation or
        Transformation spells which use the By Hour
        duration effect, the total length of the spell is equal
        to one hour per caster level, rather than one hour per
        two caster levels.
        34
        PRESTIGE CLASSES
        Master of his own Destiny (Su): The control the
        lord of change has over evolution at 8th level is truly
        remarkable, outstripping even his fellow chaos mages
        in his self-mastery. As such, it is less likely for you
        to progress quickly down your Path of Chaos; you
        are considered to be one step lower than your current
        step for the purposes of determining the effects of
        backlash. So, a chaos mage with this feat who has
        taken three steps along a Path of Chaos would take
        another step if he rolled a 2 or less on his backlash
        check, while the same mage with seven steps would
        take another step if he rolled 6 or lower. The chance
        of taking a step through backlash can never be
        lowered below 1, however.
        Twisted King
        In ancient days, chaos mages were few in number and
        scattered far and wide across the cosmos. Unable to
        share stories or techniques, and learning how to use
        their abilities only through hard, hazardous practice,
        they were paragons of will and force of personality. The most powerful, most wilful, and most arrogant
        of them came to believe they should rule over those
        who were their lessers, meaning anyone who did not
        wield chaos.
        And so they did.
        The chaos kings, as they were known, did not sit
        easy on their thrones, for all that they desired to have
        them. They resented the responsibilities which are
        the price of a king’s power and lashed out at their
        subjects. They consorted with demons, elementals,
        airy courtesans, the dark creatures of the world, the
        beasts who know the freedom that comes with giving
        oneself to chaos.
        In time, when the chaos king’s depravity grew too
        great, heroes rose up and the mage kings were thrown
        down. As is the way of things.
        But the legacy of the chaos kings was not so easily
        destroyed. Chaos remembered and what chaos
        remembers can never truly die. From time to time, a
        chaos mage who relies heavily on Domination effects
        will be infused with a tiny portion of chaos’ memory
        of the chaos kings and gain absolute dominion over
        mortal minds. In return for this gift, chaos takes from
        him all memory of kindness, charity, and ultimately
        humanity. These mages are the twisted kings.
        Hit die: d4
        Requirements
        In order to qualify to become a twisted king, the
        character must fulfil all the following requirements.
        Feats: Casting Focus, Twisted Insight
        Skills: Bluff 9 ranks, Concentration 9 ranks
        Spells: The ability to cast chaos magic spells
        Class Skills
        The twisted king’s class skills, and the relevant ability
        for each skill, are: Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con),
        Craft (alchemy) (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Gather
        Information (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge
        (arcana, history, nobility) (Int), Sense Motive (Wis)
        and Spellcraft (Int).
        Skill Points Per Level: 4 + Int modifier
        Class Features
        All the following are class features of the twisted
        king prestige class.
        Spellcasting: The character continues to improve in
        spellcasting, gaining a new chaos caster level at every
        level except 3rd, 6th and 9th. These level increases are
        not taken into account for the purposes of determining
        access to Chaos Countermagic, increases to the
        number of Multiple Effects or increasing the ability
        scores of familiars.
        Weapon and Armour Proficiency: Twisted kings
        gain no new proficiencies in any weapons or armour.
        Kindred Spirit (Ex): The twisted king is kindred to
        all those creatures whose fundamental natures are
        suffused with chaos. All creatures whose alignment
        is innately chaotic (demons, for example) are
        automatically considered friendly to the twisted king
        and will not attack him unless forced or provoked.
        Forced Focus (Su): The twisted king’s magic is
        wholly unsuited to destruction, at least of the obvious
        sort. Nor does the spark of chaos memory which
        fuels him allow him to travel under its power; the
        memory of the chaos kings is grasping and jealous
        and cannot conceive of abandoning that which it
        controls. Twisted kings cannot add Direct Damage
        or Movement effects to their chaos spells and any
        attempt to do so results in an automatic failure and
        backlash.

        Specialised Focus (Su): At 3rd level, the twisted king
        gains the Specialised Focus feat for free, though he
        must apply it to Domination effects.
        Improved Duration (Su): The twisted king’s words
        and commands are not easily shaken. Beginning
        at 5th level, the default duration of spells which are
        solely Domination effects is raised to by round. This
        means that the twisted king does not increase the DC
        of his spells when he chooses a By Round effect. As
        a consequence of this, the DC cost of selecting other
        Duration of Effect elements is lowered as shown
        below:
        Instantaneous (DC -5)
        One Round (DC -2)
        By Round ( Default)
        By Minute (DC + 5)
        By Hour (DC + 10)
        At 8th level, the default duration of spells which
        are either solely Domination effects, or which have
        Domination effects as their primary effect element, is
        increased to By Round. This means that the twisted
        king can combine Domination effects with either
        Materialisation or Transformation effects and still
        receive the improved duration bonus.
        Shifting Tongue (Ex): Chaos guides the words
        and actions of the twisted king, gifting him with
        instinctual knowledge of the right words and actions
        for any social situation. He adds one half his Wisdom
        bonus when making checks with the following skills:
        Bluff, Diplomacy, Gather Information and Intimidate. In addition, he adds one half his Wisdom bonus to all
        non-player character reaction checks.
        Crown Of Glory (Su): When the twisted king
        achieves this level of power, he is truly a worthy
        inheritor of the mantle of the chaos kings, with power
        enough to command even the strongest minds. He is
        granted several benefits.
        First, he can add the entirety of his Wisdom bonus
        to Bluff, Diplomacy, Gather Information, and
        Intimidate skill checks, and to non-player character
        reaction checks.
        Second, he gains a +1 per 2 caster levels bonus to
        all casting checks to cast spells which are solely
        Domination effects, to a maximum bonus of +5.
        Finally, the twisted king’s aura of authority is so
        unshakeable that his will cannot be denied, nor may
        it be overcome. The twisted king gains a +4 bonus
        to all Will saves versus mind affecting spells and
        spell like effects, and can use his own spells with the
        Domination effect to affect those beings which are
        normally immune to mind-affecting spells, as long as
        they have less than his character level in Hit Dice or
        levels. His abilities still cannot be used to affect non-
        intelligent beings, however.

        CHAOS FEATS
        Chaos Feats
        Thanks to the fact that a clever chaos mage
        can already use the wide variety of effects at
        his disposal to weave a near infinite variety
        of spells, chaos mages are less dependant on feats
        than other arcane spellcasters. This does not mean,
        however, that chaos magicians have no need of
        feats. A carefully selected feat can still make all
        the difference, both from the standpoint of game
        mechanics and of character fidelity.
        This chapter presents a selection of new feats which
        are designed with the unique needs of the chaos
        mage in mind. While these are not the only feats
        that your character might wish to have, they are, one
        and all, solid choices for chaos mages of any sort. In
        addition, this chapter also includes a discussion of
        existing feats and meta-magic feats, and how they
        apply to your character.
        This chapter is divided into two sections. The first
        section discusses the role of existing feats in regards
        to chaos mage characters. It offers analysis of
        existing feats, from the player’s perspective, and also
        includes changes to mechanics, where appropriate,
        to bring these feats in line with the rules for chaos
        magic selected here. The selected feats are all from
        Core Rulebook I – as that is the baseline upon which
        all other feats have been designed, analysis and
        modification of its feats should serve as a guide to
        modifying existing feats in other rules books you
        may possess.
        The second section presents a selection of all new
        feats, as well as revised versions of feats first presented
        in Encyclopaedia Arcana: Chaos Magic. These feats
        are intended for use only by chaos mages, and have
        the descriptor (Chaos) in their title – characters other
        than chaos mages can only select these feats with the
        Games Master’s permission.
        Existing Feats and the
        Chaos Mage
        The following feats are those standard feats which
        your chaos mage might find useful. Whenever
        necessary, they have been modified to better suit the
        mechanics of chaos magic.
        Augment Summoning
        As written in Core Rulebook I, this feat is useless
        to the chaos mage, as he does not truly summon
        monsters. This rewritten version of the feat may
        prove more useful, however.
        Prerequisite: Ability to cast chaos magic, Wis 15+.
        Benefits: When using Materialisation effects to
        create a chaos construct, your mastery grants it a +4
        bonus to both Strength and Dexterity for the duration
        of the spell.
        Combat Casting
        The combat casting feat can be a very good choice
        for the chaos mage, as the consequences of a failed
        Concentration check during spellcasting can be far
        more disastrous for him than for his static magic
        counterparts. That said, the chaos mage has only a
        few feat slots, at least in comparison to the wizard,
        and the Combat Casting feat is very specialised,
        meaning that, while eminently useful in a few critical
        instances, it may prove itself a poor choice over the
        long term.
        Chaos mages who specialise in Transformation
        effects, specifically those who use such effects to
        augment their own bodies for combat, may see the
        greatest benefits from this feat, particularly at lower
        levels.
        Great Fortitude, Iron Will and
        Lightning Reflexes
        The chaos mage enjoys the luxury of two good saves
        already, a mechanical advantage not shared by his
        traditional arcane spellcasting brethren. Under
        normal circumstances then, there would be little need
        for him to select any of these feats as the traditional
        spellcasting killer, attacks which require Fortitude
        saves, do not worry him overmuch.
        Unfortunately, the chaos mage’s save can quickly
        begin to suffer as he progresses along his Path of
        Chaos. When saves dip beneath acceptable levels,
        these feats quickly become more valuable and can
        spell the difference between life and death. Still,
        37
        CHAOS FEATS
        Silent Spell & Still Spell
        As written, the feats Silent Spell and Still Spell are
        simply too powerful to allow to the chaos mage,
        as he does not use spell levels as such and would
        thus not normally be penalised for casting Silent or
        Stilled spells. In addition, a mechanic already exists
        to permit the chaos mage to forgo either verbal or
        somatic components (but not both) already, so long
        as he is willing to pay the increased cost in the
        casting DC. Combining the feats and tweaking them
        slightly, brings the idea behind these feats more in
        line with chaos sorcery’s theme and mechanics:
        Subtle Chaos Magic
        Prerequisites: Ability to use chaos magic, Wis
        15+.
        Benefits: Subtle Chaos Magic allows the chaos
        mage to lower the DC penalty to cast a spell without
        vocal or somatic components (mage’s choice in
        every case, but not both in the same spell) by 2, to
        +3.
        Special: A chaos mage purchases Subtle Chaos
        magic only once. He may apply the effect either to
        silent or still spellcasting in every spell he casts, but
        not both in the same spell.
        with the plethora of effective feats available to the
        chaos mage, it is recommended that he select these
        only if he finds his saves reduced to half their normal
        level or below.
        Improved Initiative
        Improved Initiative is an excellent feat choice for those
        chaos mages who thrive on Direct Damage effects, or
        those who use Transformation or Domination effects. Coupled with even a decent Dexterity score, this feat
        can allow a chaos mage to remove one, or all of his
        enemies from the fight before they even get a chance
        to act. Alternately, it can give him the jump he needs
        to escape from more powerful enemies.
        That said, the weakness of this feat is its highly
        specialised nature. Improved Initiative’s bonus
        applies only in combat and may well prove useless
        even then, should he face opponents who are
        attacking from ambush.
        Skill Focus
        The skill focus feat can prove to be immensely useful
        over the course of a campaign, particularly if the
        caster applies its bonus to the Concentration skill. Concentration checks for chaos magic can quickly
        reach extreme levels of difficulty, so Skill Focus
        (concentration) can literally spell the difference
        between success and lethal failure. A solid choice
        at any character level, but especially useful at lower
        levels when skill bonuses are low and DCs are high.
        Spell Mastery
        Chaos mages do not know pre-set spells as such. Still,
        many chaos mages come to rely on a few standard
        weaves, those which have proven themselves useful
        in many situations. As written, the Spell Mastery
        feat does not fit with the mechanics presented in this
        book. This alternative version, however, may prove
        more useful.
        Prerequisites: Ability to cast chaos magic, Wis 17+.
        Benefits: Each time you select this feat, specify a
        specific chaos spell that the character has previously
        successfully cast. This one effect is considered to
        be mastered; reduce its final casting check DC by 3
        points whenever it is cast.
        Special: Once the spell has been specified according
        to the rules in this book, it cannot be altered in any
        way (by changing its component elements) if the
        caster wishes to receive the feat bonus when casting
        it.
        Spell Focus
        As written, Spell Focus cannot be selected by chaos
        mages, because their spells are not divided into
        schools as traditional magic is. This revised version
        of the feat, however, is useful to chaos mages,
        particularly those who favour spells of a particular
        effect.
        Prerequisites: Wisdom 15+.
        Benefits: Select an effect element (Direct Damage,
        Domination, Materialisation, Movement or
        Transformation). All saving throw DCs against
        spells of that effect element are increased by 2, so
        long as that effect is the sole effect in the spell. So,
        for example, this feat’s benefits would apply to a
        spell which consisted entirely of a single Persistent
        Damage effect, but not to one which combined
        persistent damage with a Domination effect.
        38
        CHAOS FEATS
        Special: This feat can be selected more than once. Each time, its benefits must be applied to a different
        effect element. Spells with multiple effect elements
        can benefit from this feat, but only if they consist
        solely of effects which are enhanced by Spell Focus
        – employing multiple Spell Focus feats within the
        same spell still only means that the saving throw DC
        is modified by +2, not +4.
        Spell Penetration
        One of the chief strengths of the chaos mage is their
        steadily increasing ability to pierce the defences of
        hardy and resistant creatures. Spell resistance can
        be overcome through chaos magic (see the Chaos
        Sorcery chapter) but this is a risky proposition to say
        the least. This feat can help alleviate that problem,
        bringing the chaos mage to terrifying levels of
        power in comparison to his traditional static magic
        counterparts. Since the majority of creatures with
        high levels of spell resistance are of a high Challenge
        Rating, a typical player can delay selecting this feat
        until late in his character’s adventures when spell
        resistant creatures crop up more often.
        New Feats
        The following feats are either all new, or are
        revamped and represented from the Encyclopaedia
        Arcana: Chaos Magic book.
        Attune Other (Chaos)
        Chaos is a fickle mistress and, when bound to
        corporeal objects, is difficult to attune to those who
        do not understand its power. You, however, have
        learned the secret of crafting powerful items which
        can be used with ease by anyone.
        Prerequisites: The ability to craft chaos magic items,
        Wis 15+.
        Benefits: Other people can attune to items you create
        without the necessity of succeeding at a Will save and
        at a cost of only 1 point of temporary ability score
        loss, rather than 2.
        Blood of Chaos (Chaos)
        Your blood is a seething cauldron of pure chaos, and
        you are highly resistant to its negative effects.
        Prerequisites: Ability to cast chaos magic,
        Endurance.
        Benefits: You suffer one less point of damage every
        time you successfully cast a chaos magic spell,
        though this cannot reduce the damage to below one
        point.
        Body of Chaos (Chaos)
        Your body has been benevolently changed by its
        exposure to chaos and you now swim its depths with
        little fear of injury.
        Prerequisites: Blood of Chaos, Con 15+.
        Benefits: You suffer one less point of damage every
        time you cast a chaos magic spell, whether it is
        successful or not.
        Casting Focus (Chaos)
        You have disciplined yourself to the demands of
        chaos and can readily shape its raw essence to serve
        your whims. This keen focus has a price though…
        the forces of chaos can be bidden only so far. Should
        the chaos mage incur backlash, they increase their
        chance of falling down a Path of Chaos.
        Prerequisites: Ability to cast chaos magic, Iron
        Will.
        Benefits: You receive a +1 bonus to all casting
        checks made when using chaos magic. It is slightly
        easier for you to progress further along your Path
        of Chaos; you are considered to be one step further
        along your path for the purposes of determining the
        effects of backlash only. So, a chaos mage with this
        feat who has taken three steps along a Path of Chaos
        would take another step if he rolled a 4 or less on
        his backlash check, while the same mage with seven
        steps would take another step if he rolled 8 or lower.
        Chaos Corona (Chaos)
        When you use chaos magic, a corona of unreality fills
        the air around you, protecting you from harm.
        Prerequisites: Ability to cast chaos magic, Cha 15+.
        Benefits: Immediately upon successfully casting a
        chaos magic spell, you are surrounded by a flickering
        aura of primal chaos, which twists and reshapes
        blows, protecting you from injury. You gain damage
        reduction 2/lawful which lasts for one full round. This damage reduction stacks with any other damage
        reduction the character may possess.
        Special: This feat can be selected twice. The second
        time it is chosen, the damage reduction becomes 3/
        39
        CHAOS FEATS
        lawful and the mage gains a +1 bonus to all Fortitude
        saves.
        Chaotic Healing (Chaos)
        Your body is enshrouded and cradled by chaos energy
        at all times, which plays havoc with its capabilities. One day you are bolstered by its energy, the next
        drained.
        Prerequisites: Blood of Chaos, Con 13+.
        Benefits: You heal erratically while resting. Instead
        of using normal healing rules, the powers of chaos
        restore 1d6-2 hit points per character level to you after
        each full rest period. The minimum damage healed is
        1 hit point – it is impossible to suffer damage through
        the use of this feat.
        Enhanced Familiar (Chaos)
        Your chaos familiar’s physical abilities are more
        closely linked to your own, providing it with a much
        greater physical presence than most other familiars.
        Prerequisites: A chaos magic familiar, Wis 15+, Str
        or Dex or Con 13+.
        Benefits: When you gain this feat, you may
        immediately add your highest modifier in Str, Dex
        or Con to any one of your familiar’s ability scores. This is a permanent enhancement for your familiar;
        if your ability modifier later increases, the familiar’s
        does not.
        Special: This feat may be taken multiple times. It’s
        effects stack.
        Immutable Will (Chaos)
        You have an iron resolve and incredible force of
        personality that refuses to fall before the might of
        chaos. While other chaos mages walk the winding
        paths to their doom, you refuse to suffer that
        ignominious fate.
        Prerequisites: Ability to cast chaos magic, Wis 17+,
        Cha 13+.
        Benefits: You pay only half the normal amount of
        experience necessary to use the Purge Chaos class
        feature.
        Luck of the Damned (Chaos)
        Whether they know it or not, every living being is
        surrounded by limitless possibilities, both good and
        bad, at all times. You just happen to have a monopoly
        on the good.
        Prerequisites: Ability to cast chaos magic.
        Benefits: You are surrounded by good fortune and
        gain a floating luck bonus of +2. Each day, you
        assign this luck bonus to any one skill you possess,
        or to one saving throw. The bonus applies for the
        duration of the day, or until you fail a check with
        the selected skill or saving throw (whichever comes
        first). This bonus represents the instinctual ease with
        which you always select the best possible outcome
        in your endeavours. If you do fail this skill check or
        saving throw that day, you suffer a –1 penalty to that
        skill or save for the remainder of the day.
        Specialised Focus (Chaos)
        You have concentrated your will along specific
        chaotic aspects and can focus these forces with
        assured ease. Just don’t get too cocky.
        Prerequisites: Casting Focus, Wis 19+.
        Benefits: Choose one effect element. When casting
        spells which have this element as their primary effect,
        you gain a +2 bonus to caster checks (this stacks with
        Casting Focus). It is much easier for you to progress
        further along your Path of Chaos as well; you are
        considered to be two steps further along your path for
        the purposes of determining the effects of backlash
        only. So, a chaos mage with this feat who has taken
        three steps along a Path of Chaos would take another
        step if he rolled a 5 or less on his backlash check,
        while the same mage with seven steps would take
        another step if he rolled 9 or lower.
        Special: You can take this feat twice, with the benefits
        applying to a different effect element each time.
        Split Path (Chaos)
        You walk more than one Path of Chaos, suffering
        double the torments but in so doing delaying the
        inevitable end.
        Prerequisites: At least one step on a Path of Chaos.
        Benefits: The first time you fail a backlash check after
        selecting this feat, you do not take an additional step
        along your Path of Chaos. Instead, you take the first
        step on a new path. From that point on, you walk two
        paths. Each time you would be forced to take a step,
        you choose one or the other path to progress along. In the beginning, you must automatically select the
        40
        CHAOS FEATS
        new path, until you have taken as many steps along it
        as you have along your original path; from that point
        on, you must alternate steps along each path. You
        gain the benefits and suffer the penalties of each path,
        and are lost should you reach the tenth step of either. Should you wish to Purge steps, you must negate each
        step along each path separately and you cannot purge
        a step if it would leave more than one step difference
        between your two paths. For example, a mage who
        has progressed 5 steps along one path and 4 along
        another could Purge a step from his first path, leaving
        him on the 4th steps in each, but could not purge a step
        from his second path.
        Special: This feat can only be selected once.
        Symbiotic Familiar (Chaos)
        You dedicate a portion of your own experience to
        your familiar, allowing it to increase in skill as you
        gain levels.
        Prerequisites: Enhanced Familiar.
        Benefits: You donate 5% of your experience to your
        familiar. Your familiar then gains 2 skill points in a
        skill of your choice whenever you gain a level. Your
        familiar my never have more ranks in a given skill
        than you have chaos mage levels +3, as it relies on
        your knowledge and personal connection to chaos to
        sustain its own existence.
        Locked in Chaos (Chaos)
        Your body has embraced the twisted changes of
        the first steps along your Path of Chaos more fully
        than you would have imagined possible. While this
        means your body has been irrevocably changed, it
        also makes it more difficult for chaos to change you
        further.
        Prerequisites: Ability to cast chaos magic.
        Benefits: Every step along your Path of Chaos is now
        considered a locked step, meaning you must spend
        double the normal amount of experience to purge it
        (see the Chaos Mage Character Class chapter). It is
        much more difficult for you to progress further along
        your path as well; you are considered to be two steps
        lower (to a minimum of one step) along your path for
        the purposes of determining the effects of backlash
        only. So, a chaos mage with this feat who has taken
        three steps along a Path of Chaos would only take
        another step if he rolled a 1 on his backlash check,
        while the same mage with seven steps would only
        take another if he rolled 5 or lower.
        Special: Should a mage with the feat Split Path select
        this feat, the benefits and penalties are applied to both
        paths. This feat cannot be selected by a character
        who has the Immutable Will feat, nor may a character
        with this feat later select Immutable Will.
        Touch of Chaos (Chaos)
        Your connection with the permeating chaos of reality
        grants a certain kinship with all things chaotic,
        whether or not they are of your creation.
        Prerequisite: Wis 15+.
        Benefits: You may attune yourself to chaos magic
        items not of your creation relatively easily (see the
        Tools of the Trade chapter for details). You only
        reduce one ability score by one point per infusion
        when attuning to a foreign chaos magic item. Should
        the attunement fail you will not suffer hit point
        damage, though temporary ability damage will be
        applied as normal.
        Twisted Insight (Chaos)
        You hear the truths that chaos whispers from the
        place beyond darkness and light and gain a strange
        understanding of all things.
        Prerequisites: Wis 19+.
        Benefits: You add half your Wisdom bonus (in lieu
        of your Intelligence bonus) to all Intelligence-based
        skills.

        PATHS OF CHAOS
        Paths of
        Chaos
        The Necessity of Defined Paths
        While the idea of prescribed mutation paths may
        seem to run counter to the notion of chaos as endless
        possibility, it is necessary from a mechanical
        standpoint to define and describe the exact changes
        which occur in a character’s body. It is also
        representative of the chaos mage’s subconscious
        relentlessly pushing him towards his own destruction
        in a manner most horrific to him.
        That said, you are free to consider the paths presented
        in this book to be nothing more than detailed
        examples of the sorts of mutations that chaos mages
        might suffer. Players and Games Masters alike are
        encouraged to create new Paths of Chaos, using the
        ones presented here as rough guides.
        Chaos magic is both a rigorous science and a
        demanding art, one that practitioners suffer
        greatly for. The very act of channelling and
        sculpting chaos energy into magic spells is both
        painful and very, very dangerous. Yet there is greater
        danger still for those who do not practice their art
        with temperance and caution. Overzealous use of
        chaos magic can and will lead to dire consequences
        for chaos mages, expert and rank novice alike. Mutation, the desecration of body and spirit, and
        ultimately the extinguishing of identity – these are
        the horrors awaiting those who are not careful and
        judicious in their spellcasting. Those who understand
        the nature of chaos have a name for the process of
        gradual, permanent mutation – they call it walking
        the Paths of Chaos.
        What Are the Paths of
        Chaos?
        Chaos mages toy with the power of creation at their
        own peril. The forces they bind into their service are
        capable of altering reality in strange and alien ways
        and they are more than capable of doing the same to
        the caster’s body. Each of the Paths of Chaos is a
        10-stage mechanic which represents the changes that
        are wrought in the bodies, minds and souls of chaos
        mages as they begin to lose control.
        Backlash and its
        Effects
        Whenever a chaos mage rolls a ‘1’ for a casting
        check, a backlash has occurred.
        When a backlash occurs for the very first time, the
        Games Master and player work together to select a
        Path of Chaos for the character, as detailed below. The character automatically receives the first step
        upon that path. When subsequent backlashes occur,
        1d20 is rolled. If the result is equal to or less than
        the number of steps the character has on his Path of
        Chaos, another step is taken.
        The effects listed at each step are applied immediately,
        potentially causing great suffering for the afflicted
        chaos mage. Unless otherwise stated, all effects are
        permanent and any that reduce his ability scores to
        0 or less cause the chaos mage to be automatically
        slain by the ravenous energy flooding his body. It is
        possible for a chaos mage to take a step back along
        his path, though this is normally a difficult and
        expensive process (see the Chaos Mage Character
        Class chapter for details). If this is achieved, the
        chaos mage instantly loses all bonuses and penalties
        associated with the step just purged.
        As will quickly become apparent, chaos mages just
        starting out in their careers will advance relatively
        slowly along their Path of Chaos. As they progress
        further, however, the advancement will rapidly
        speed up as they continue to use their powers, with
        potentially deadly consequences.
        The Paths
        When a chaos mage experiences a backlash for the
        very first time, he takes his first step upon one of the
        Paths of Chaos described below. Once a path has
        been selected, a chaos mage cannot normally choose
        another (see the Split Path feat in the Chaos Feats
        chapter for an exception) as his destiny is now fixed
        for all time. All the penalties and bonuses stack,
        so a chaos mage who is suffering a –1 penalty to
        Charisma-based skills and a –1 penalty to Diplomacy
        checks suffers a total –2 modifier when making
        Diplomacy checks.
        The 10 Paths
        † Path of Agonised Ecstasy – The pain wrought by
        chaos magic gradually perverts the character’s
        42
        PATHS OF CHAOS
        Locked Steps on the Paths of Chaos
        Certain steps along the chaos paths are designated as
        locked steps – specifically the 4th and 8th steps along
        every path. These steps are especially hard for the
        chaos mage to divest himself of, and he must pay
        double the normal amount of experience required to
        purge a step.
        Naturally, this creates a mechanical barrier to
        those wishing to completely divest themselves of
        chaos perversion. A kind Games Master might
        consider eliminating locked steps, though this has
        the consequence of allowing chaos mages to easily
        purge themselves of what are intended to be major
        drawbacks to travelling the wild ways.
        senses until he senses nothing accurately and
        becomes a travesty of a sentient being.
        † Path of Berserk Growth – The path of the forest,
        and the wilderness. The caster becomes, whether
        he likes it or not, one with nature.
        † Path of Bloody Rage – The character is forever
        tormented with dreams of violence and death. Violence and death which he perpetrates.
        † Path of Rapid Regression – This path is a slow,
        agonized journey into primal devolution.
        † Path of Screaming Shadows – The character who
        succumbs to this path becomes a literal shadow of
        his former self.
        † Path of Shrieking Pain – The character who follows
        this path experiences inhuman levels of pain during
        his every waking moment.
        † Path of Teratic Growth – Strange tumours and
        growths appear on the mage’s body, developing
        until his entire form is a walking womb for bizarre,
        twisted creatures.
        † Path of Tortured Stone – The character takes on the
        strength and consistency of stone and eventually
        melds with the living earth, lost forever.
        † Path of Whispered Madness – Not all prisons are
        physical ones. The chaos mage on this path is
        tormented by chaos delusions, and is eventually
        smothered by them.
        † Path of the Whore – The character on this path
        becomes obsessed with transactions of all sorts, an
        echo of the give and take required in chaos sorcery. It is recommended that the Path of Chaos the character
        travels along be related thematically to his actions in
        the game, particularly those actions which involve
        use of spells. So, for example, a character who
        revels in launching blast after blast of Direct Damage
        oriented spells is a likely candidate for the Path of
        Bloody Rage, while a sculptor who twists flesh to
        serve his own end would often be doomed to the
        Path of Shrieking Pain or Path of Rapid Regression. In any case, when a character takes his first step, his
        fate is sealed, with each additional step bringing him
        that much closer to his ultimate disillusionment and
        immersion into the boiling seas of primal chaos.
        Of course, no chaos mage ever has to take more than
        the initial step along a path. If the price is too much
        to bear, he can stop himself at any time, so long as
        he is willing to never practice wild sorcery again. If
        a chaos mage stops casting his wild magic, he will
        not suffer backlash, nor ever progress in chaos mage
        levels. Few have such strength of will, but the choice
        is always there.
        The Path of Agonised
        Ecstasy
        The chaotic pathways forged through the body of
        the chaos mage become overloaded with sensation
        when this path is walked. Painful experiences
        become intensely pleasurable, while other sensations
        are magnified and distorted in similar ways by the
        forces of chaos. The distracting nature of these
        changes leaves many chaos mages completely mad,
        their minds unable to process the new floods of
        sensation they experience, reducing them to drooling
        imbeciles.
        Step 1 – Love of the Lash
        Sources of pain now provide pleasure for the chaos
        mage, though very intense pains overwhelm this and
        are still agonisingly painful.
        Step 2 – Self Abuse
        The chaos mage finds it impossible to stop inflicting
        minor injuries upon his person. He scratches at
        himself, uses dagger tips to cut furrows in his flesh and
        gnaws mercilessly at his own tongue. The pleasure
        he derives from these experiences is indescribable,
        leaving others vaguely disturbed if they spend more
        than a few minutes in his presence. The scratches and
        other wounds are clearly visible, though they are not
        yet detrimental to his health.
        The character receives a +4 bonus to resist pain of any
        type or origin. Others find him somewhat disturbing,
        and he suffers a –1 penalty to all Charisma-based
        checks.
        43
        PATHS OF CHAOS
        Step 3 – Embrace of Pain
        The chaos mage has successfully mastered his pain at
        this point and can ride out the waves of pleasure that
        assault him when his body is damaged.
        The chaos mage receives a +2 bonus to any
        Concentration checks he must make as a result of
        injury.
        Step 4 – Sensory Skew
        Nothing the chaos mage perceives is quite right, any
        longer. His tastes are radically changed, leaving him
        with a hunger for offal and dirt while his stomach
        recoils at the thought of steak or lobster. Colours
        shift and skew before him and whispers become roars
        while loud noises are reduced to an indecipherable
        background murmur.
        The changes in his senses leave the chaos mage with
        a –1 penalty to all Initiative checks he makes, and a
        –1 penalty to all Listen, Search and Spot skill checks. On the other hand, the mage is now utterly inured
        to the pain and only magically created pain has a
        chance of affecting him – he is completely immune
        to mundane torture.
        Step 5 – Lust for Horror
        In addition to the physical pleasure brought on by
        pain, the chaos mage becomes mentally aroused by
        things others find horrific.
        As a result of the breakdown in his sensory
        perceptions, the chaos mage receives a +2 saving
        throw bonus versus any spell, spell-like ability or
        circumstance that would normally cause fear. The
        stress on his system is taking its toll, however, and
        the mage loses 2d4 hit points from his maximum.
        Step 6 – Debilitating Ecstasy
        The injuries the chaos mage inflicts upon himself
        become more severe and the wounds are never given
        a chance to heal.
        This step reduces the chaos mage’s Constitution
        score by 2 points.
        Step 7 – Image of Obsession
        Not content to keep his injuries hidden from the
        world, the chaos mage feels the need to share his
        ecstatic pain with others. Pliers and candle flames
        reduce his lips to withered worms of grey scar tissue,
        while constant cutting at his nostrils for that most
        exquisite pain has rendered his nasal pages into a
        fretted and flayed mess in the centre of his face.
        As a result, the chaos mage has a hard time dealing
        with others and his penalty to Charisma-based checks
        increases to –3. If the chaos mage ever needs to make
        a Charisma check to attempt to horrify or intimidate
        others, there is no penalty.
        Step 8 – Rushing Feedback
        The mage’s senses are so badly crosswired that pain
        translates to pleasure and pleasure to pain. When
        he is not concentrating on stopping the cycle, this
        can lead to a feedback loop that wracks his nervous
        system with conflicting blasts of pain and skull-
        rattling waves of pleasure that leave him unable to
        function.
        Whenever the chaos mage suffers a number of hit
        points of damage equal to or greater than one-half of
        his current Constitution score, he must immediately
        make a Concentration skill check (DC 10 + damage
        suffered by the attack). If this check succeeds, he
        may continue acting as normal (though additional
        Concentration checks may be needed if he is casting
        a spell, for example). Otherwise, he immediately
        stunned for 1d3 rounds, after which he regains
        control of his nerves.
        Step 9 – Addiction to Pain
        The pleasure the chaos mage receives from physical
        injury becomes so great he subconsciously sabotages
        his body’s natural instincts for survival.
        He is always considered flat-footed against any
        attacks or spells directed against him by a creature
        that has already injured him during the current
        combat. However, no pain of any sort will ever
        affect him mentally; the sensation of pain has been
        completely transmuted to pleasure. His bonus to
        resist fear effects increases to +4.
        Step 10 – Viral Sensation
        The chaos mage becomes a chaotic wave of energy
        laden with his own confused sensations. The physical
        body is transmuted into a pure representation of his
        own agonised ecstasy, which is in turn returned to the
        chaotic flows of the universe. The spot of his passing
        becomes renowned among those who seek extreme
        pleasures or heights of pain, and pilgrims of the outré
        find their way to his grave for midnight trysts in the
        hopes of receiving some sort of orgasmic insight.
        44
        PATHS OF CHAOS
        The Path of Berserk
        Growth
        The Path of Berserk Growth is the way of the
        wilderness, the way of primal growth, of bloom, of
        blossom, of pollen and sticky sap. Seeping chaos
        magic fuses with the mage, causing his body to
        explode into verdant growth, strange vegetation and
        fungal growth sprouting from his joints and from his
        soft, moist crevices. As the mage stumbles along
        the path, the growths become more alien and more
        prolific, his body a breeding ground for vegetation
        which mortal eyes cannot conceive. In the end, the
        power of chaos sunders the characters mind and body
        and his soul boils away, leaving only a gibbering
        grove of loathsome vegetation.
        Step 1 – Blades of Chaos
        The chaos mage’s hair shifts colour, giving way to
        myriad shades of green. It’s texture changes as well,
        becoming wide and flat as blades of grass. Moving,
        or even the soft caress of the wind, sets the character
        to rustling like a tree in the autumn breeze. A faint
        miasma of the swamp hangs about the character
        like a cloud, thought this can be easily disguised by
        perfumed oils and other fragrances. Clothing and
        headgear, or a good cloak, can easily disguise the
        changes, but it is impossible to remove the blades
        permanently, as they regrow almost instantly when
        cut. Cut blades exude a combination of blood and
        sap, which reeks of stinkweed and is sticky to the
        touch.
        The strangely grassy hair the chaos mage possesses
        cannot be disguised with the use of chaos magic
        – should he change forms, for example, any fur or
        hair he gained would still resemble blades of grass. Step 2 – Startling Growth
        Strange, toadstool shaped growth erupt from the flesh
        of the chaos mage, pocking his skin with coin sized
        patches of unnatural fungus. The fungus continually
        grows and sloughs off in patches, eventually
        appearing on every portion of the character’s flesh,
        catching in his clothing and littering areas where he
        rests with choking dust spores. Hiding the growths
        is possible, but periodic appearances on the face and
        neck require a mask to cover.
        Upon achieving this step, the character inherits some
        small measure of fungus’ ability to resist toxins of
        all sorts. He gains acid resistance 2 and receives
        a +1 bonus to saves against acid and non-magical
        poisons.
        Step 3 – Supple Stalks
        The chaos mage suffers an explosion of itching,
        straw-like stalks from his flesh; the thin brittle spines
        cover the character from head to toe, pushing their
        way through clothing with ease. The caster comes
        to look like a hideous scarecrow, and the hideous
        itching makes it nearly impossible for the chaos
        mage to focus his attention on anything for long. As a
        result, the chaos mage suffers a permanent -2 penalty
        to all Concentration checks and a -1 penalty to all
        Charisma-based skill checks, as he is no longer able
        to direct the full strength of his personality toward
        others.
        Step 4 – Green Resilience
        On this step on the Path, the chaos mage’s skin
        becomes hard and brown, more akin to wood than
        flesh. While the grains and patterns on his ‘skin’ are strangely appealing, the stalks blades and fungal
        lesions from the earlier stages of chaos are still
        present, causing the character to resemble a tree
        covered with verdant growth. The thick, hard skin
        grants a +1 natural Armour Class bonus to the chaos
        mage’s Armour Class.
        45
        PATHS OF CHAOS
        Step 5 – Chaotic Flowering
        A crown of richly coloured, unnatural looking flowers
        sprout from the skull of the character. The flowers
        are permanent, and if plucked they weep blood and
        sap until they grow back over the space of a few
        hours. The chaos mage can hide the flowers beneath
        a helm, hood, or cap, but it will be difficult. The
        character now bears little resemblance to anything
        mortal, resembling some sort of tree spirit, albeit a
        completely unwholesome one.
        To his benefit, the alien fronts which cover his
        brow release soothing chemicals which sing to him
        the secrets of bending chaos to his will; he gains a
        permanent +1 bonus to all final casting checks when
        using chaos sorcery. These chemicals can also be
        harvested by alchemists and mages to create both
        strong soporifics and highly addictive drugs. Should
        the character encounter those of either profession, he
        will likely be hunted like the natural resource he has
        become.
        Step 6 – Sprouting Limbs
        Slender wooden branches erupt forth from the chaos
        mage’s skin, creating strange humps and bulges
        across the surface of his body and choking his joints
        with thick tangles of root and vine. More painful than
        the worst arthritis, the victim can only find relief by
        lying or standing completely still. Still, the hideous
        growth is not without some small benefit, as it further
        toughens his body.
        Upon reaching this step, the chaos mage suffers loses
        of 2 points of Dexterity. In return, his natural Armour
        Class bonus increases to +2.
        Step 7 – Fruiting Flesh
        An irritating juice begins to drip from the fungus
        growing on the chaos mage’s skin, causing a fiery,
        itching rash wherever it falls. This juice affects
        other even more than it does the mage, and with an
        effect far more damaging than worst case of poison
        ivy. The burning and irritation from contact with
        the character makes any human contact virtually
        impossible, meaning both the lover’s caress and the
        basic pleasure of human company is denied him – the
        mage is alone in green misery. The constant pain and
        distraction makes it difficult for the mage to think of
        anything but his own agony..
        The chaos mage suffers 2 points of Charisma loss. The upside of this, if there is such a thing, is that the
        character’s body is now a living weapon. Unprotected
        flesh which comes in contact with the mage is
        instantly exposed to the sap’s harmful effects. A
        Fortitude save (DC 17) is required to avoid suffering
        1d6 points of temporary Constitution damage.
        Step 8 – Skin of Spring’s Blossom
        Exotic foliage blooms from the character’s flesh and
        thick vines uncoil from his joints and down his spine. The transformation completely alters the character’s
        appearance, leaving him changed into something... else. Any resemblance to his original form is now
        completely obliterated. By now, misery, loneliness
        and despair are likely constant companions, though
        strangely, birds begin to find the character attractive
        and will often try to roost on him, feeding on his
        growths.
        The character loses another 2 points of Dexterity,
        but his natural Armour Class bonus increases to +3,
        his acid resistance increases to 5 and he is rendered
        completely immune to natural poisons. Finally,
        creatures of the plant subtype are automatically
        considered friendly to him, and will not attack unless
        provoked.
        Step 9 – Absurd Fecundity
        The character’s entire body becomes a shifting mass
        of vegetation, his bones green saplings with motile
        roots, his muscled coiled bundles of vine and densely
        packed lichen. Flowers and patches of bark take the
        place of skin, and the body becomes dangerously
        unstable. Even more so than before, the only relief
        the chaos mage finds is when he remains still, though
        he instantly begins to take root if he does so – this has
        no mechanical effect, but it is intensely disturbing to
        watch the character have to tear himself loose from
        the soil.
        Some practitioners, there minds nearly gone or at
        least no longer human, give up wild sorcery and
        become something like true forest spirits, allying
        with local druids and, while never regaining anything
        like humanity, at least avoiding the ultimate fate of
        more hateful and determined sorcerers.
        Each morning, the chaos mage loses 2 points from
        one randomly chosen physical ability score (Strength,
        Dexterity, or Constitution). Each day the penalised
        score is returned to normal, and another ability is
        penalised.
        46
        PATHS OF CHAOS
        Simultaneously, the chaos mage gains regeneration 1
        (cold), meaning he regains 1 hit point a round even
        if brought below 0. Note that regeneration does
        not convert or recover hit points lost from chaos
        spellcasting.
        Step 10 – Grove of Chaos
        The ultimate destination on the Path of Berserk
        Growth and the point at which the mage is lost to the
        world. What little is left of the chaos mage’s mind
        and body disappears in an explosion of botanical
        frenzy. The character fuses with his environment,
        transforming into a small grove of stunted, alien trees
        and bizarre plant life. The grove is devoid of sentient
        life, though it frequently retains some haunting
        reminder of the original man – a love of birds, or
        perhaps flowers the colour of the victim’s eyes. The
        character is lost forever.
        The Path of Bloody
        Rage
        For some chaos mages, the flow of chaos through
        their veins fills them with strange visions and
        feelings of immortality. For others, its is like an
        angry, red tide, leading to an existence tortured by
        dreams of blood and violence. The power of chaos
        often unlocks base instincts in those who tap its flow;
        those who stumble upon this path will find their
        darkest thoughts made manifest by the forces they
        believed they commanded. The Path of Bloody Rage
        is a constant companion, a twisted shadow which
        colours and flavours the world in wet, red bitterness
        and fury. In the end, all who walk this path will feel
        their soul, their body and their mind burn away in an
        all – consuming maelstrom of rage.
        Step 1 – Chaotic Anger
        The practitioner is always on the edge for no
        particular reason. Tiny problems are magnified to
        become unsurpassable difficulties and anger spirals
        out of control. Frequently this is not noticed as a
        mark of chaos, as many chaos mages are of a fiery
        temperament anyway. Those watching closely will
        be able to note the lack of true control, and the hint of
        madness in the mage’s eyes.
        When confronted with a trying situation, the chaos
        mage is prone to fits of petulant anger. Any time a
        setback occurs (at the Games Master’s discretion),
        the chaos mage must succeed at a Will save against
        a DC of 10 or give in to anger. This anger has no
        mechanical effect, but is definitely noticeable to those
        who know the caster well.
        Step 2 – Venomous Tongue
        Irritation grows, every remark is a slight, every
        whisper quiet slander, each action a call for
        immediate, caustic response. The chaos mage finds
        it difficult to be civil to those around him, even with
        his closest friends and when failure to do so will lead
        to trouble.
        Whenever the chaos mage finds himself in a position
        where being polite would prove helpful, he must
        succeed at a Will save against DC 15 or lose control
        of his caustic tongue. As a result of this,
        the chaos mage suffers a -1 penalty to all
        Diplomacy skill checks.
        Step 3 – Howling Epithets
        The mage’s uncontrollable anger is now
        apparent to all but the chaos mage himself. At this step of the path, anger and irritation
        give way to outright verbal rage. Anytime
        the character fails an action (whether
        through dice rolls or roleplay), He spends
        one move equivalent action barking curses
        at all around him. The chaos mage firmly
        believes that others are conspiring to make
        him fail and no amount of evidence to the
        contrary convinces him otherwise.
        Unable to be civil for longer than a few
        minutes at a time, the chaos mage suffers
        47
        PATHS OF CHAOS
        a -1 penalty to all Charisma-based skills (with the
        exception of Intimidation) and he gains a +1 bonus to
        all Intimidation skill checks.
        Step 4 – Barbed Speech
        At this point, the chaos mage is consumed with
        seething anger at all times. Frequently, this is
        accompanied by crawling paranoia and suspicion. Everyone, friend and foe alike, is against him and
        he must strike back. Burning passions and a sense
        of barely restrained violence are present at all times,
        frightening calmer individuals. Anyone who opposes
        the mage, who so much as disagrees with him, is
        subjected to 1d4 rounds of verbal abuse.
        This level of anger is somewhat of a boon to the mage,
        at least in some ways, as he gains a +2 circumstance
        bonus to all final casting DC checks when using
        Direct Damage effects against those who are
        opposing him. In addition, his bonus when making
        Intimidation attempts increases to +3. Conversely, he
        suffers a -2 penalty to his Charisma score.
        Step 5 – Anger’s Hand
        Any kind of temper control is beyond the reach of
        the chaos mage and he is consumed with white-hot
        anger at all times. His very soul becomes blacked by
        unrestrained hate and anyone who crosses his path is
        in danger of sudden attack.
        The chaos mage is so filled with hate that he must
        succeed at a Will save against DC 10 or assault
        anyone that angers or opposes him in any way. If the
        save is successful, the mage must still spend a full
        round venting his anger and disparaging the target of
        his outburst.
        Possessed by cold fury at all times, the character
        gains 2 points of Strength . On the downside, he
        suffers a further -2 penalty to Diplomacy skill checks
        and now suffers a -2 penalty to Sense Motive checks
        – he automatically believes everyone is out to get
        him, so he is unable to truly understand the motives
        of others.
        Step 6 – Lash of Rage
        At this point, the mage is truly mad, anger and
        hatred having consumed him, to the point where cold
        relentless malice grips mind and soul when burning
        rage does not.
        The chaos mage can turn this fury to his advantage, at
        least to some degree. His circumstance bonus to final
        casting DCs with Direct Damage spells increases
        to +3, and his bonus to Intimidation skill checks
        increases to +5. However, his rage makes it difficult
        for him to concentrate and he suffers a -2 penalty to
        all Concentration checks.
        Step 7 – Face of Hate
        Boiling undercurrents of chaos twist the caster’s
        features, reflecting the hatred burning within. This
        takes many forms, some overt, others subtle. These
        changes can range from eyes that burn like hot coals
        to small, ineffectual devil’s horns, to most anything
        else the Games Master and player can imagine.
        Even if the changes are not overtly obvious, the depths
        of the mage’s insanity cannot be hidden. Hygiene
        suffers as bathing becomes a thing of the past, and
        even defecation is merely another way of venting ire
        and rancour upon the world. The character’s penalty
        to Charisma-based skill checks increases to -3 (with
        the exception of Intimidation) and is unable to be
        civil for more than a minute at a time.
        Step 8 – Dire Provocation
        At this point, the victim is so consumed with fury that
        he can no longer discern friend from foe, meaning
        anyone who opposes him may become the target of
        attack, or at the very least a severe tongue lashing.
        Anytime the character is confronted, for any reason,
        he must succeed at a Will save against a DC of 15 or
        attack the individual who provoked him with his full
        power. At this point, all non-player character reaction
        checks are assumed to be hostile and the character
        suffers a further -2 penalty to all Concentration
        checks.
        Step 9 – Thirst for Blood
        The chaos mage is now a berserk killer, having
        realised that the solution to any problem is the
        application of extreme violence. The ‘problem’ can be almost anything, from a direct insult to an
        accidental jostling in the marketplace. The chaos
        mage’s wrath can take any form, from cold-blooded
        stalking and murder, to outright orgies of slaughter.
        The character must kill one sentient being every day
        or suffer from horrible fits of rage that incapacitate
        him for hours. If the character fails to kill, he must
        succeed at a Will save against DC 20 or sink into
        48
        PATHS OF CHAOS
        1d12 hours of raving and berserk fury. If any attempt
        to argue or oppose the character during this time, the
        mage attacks with murderous intent.
        Step 10 – Spirit of Anger
        The moment the chaos mage succumbs to this step,
        his body explodes in a cataclysm of ichor and boiling
        flame. This will cause the Xd6 damage (where X is
        the character’s chaos mage level) to all within 10
        feet of the caster, with a Reflex save allowed for half
        damage (DC equal to 10 + the character’s chaos mage
        level). His life is snuffed in a moment and his soul is
        devoured by chaos instantaneously.
        The Path of Rapid
        Regression
        Chaos is birth and death, beginning and ending. Mages who follow this path find themselves sinking
        into a primal, bestial state, their flesh and psyche
        transforming to something feral. The beast within
        stalks them, both physically and mentally, clawing
        and gnawing at their thoughts and their civilised
        beliefs. In the end, those who succumb to this path
        devolve into burbling protoplasm, reduced to primal
        elements by the chaos they thought they controlled.
        Step 1 – Eyes of the Wild
        Accompanied by a low moan of pain, the chaos
        mage’s eyes migrate to the edge of his face, over
        a period of 1d6 days. His pupils split into
        hourglass shapes, or narrow to slits like a cat’s. The character may resemble a fish, bear, deer,
        or any other animal, and the physical changes
        are often accompanied by strange quirks the
        mage does not notice himself. For example,
        he may startle like a doe if surprised, grunt
        strangely without realising it, or exhibit other
        slightly animalistic traits.
        Step 2 – Primal Musk
        The cloying scent of the beast clings to the
        character, a strong, unpleasant smell which
        rises from his skin, and clings to his clothes
        and other belongings. The nature of the scent is
        variable, but most often is related to the chaotic
        appearance of Eyes of the Wild. Again, the
        character begins to show minor bestial traits,
        using his hands rather than utensils to eat, or
        simply dipping his face into a bowl rather than
        raising it to drink.
        The character gains a +2 bonus to all non-player
        character reaction checks involving animals and a
        +1 insight bonus to all Handle Animal checks. It
        is off-putting for most civilised beings, though, and
        the character incurs a –1 penalty to all non-player
        character reaction checks involving those who care
        about pleasant body odour.
        Step 3 – Bestial Pelt
        With a tormented scream, the practitioner falls to the
        ground, his flesh rippling horribly. Thick matted fur
        erupts from his skin, covering him from head to toe. Other small, animalistic traits begin to appear as well,
        such as the beginnings of a stunted snout, pointed ears
        or vestigial horns. Some may mistakenly believe the
        mage to be a werewolf.
        The thick pelt grants the mage cold resistance 2 and
        a +1 natural Armour Class bonus. Conversely, as the
        wild begins to seize his mind, he loses touch with
        what it means to be human (or whichever race he
        belongs to), suffering a -2 penalty to all Charisma-
        based skill checks that do not involve animals.
        Step 4 – Animal Reflexes
        The mage goes into an excruciating fit resembling
        animalistic epilepsy. While little or no outward
        change is apparent, the practitioner’s nerve endings
        and sensory organs are altered. As the character’s
        body changes, his senses become far more acute, his
        49
        PATHS OF CHAOS
        muscles begin to react faster, and his mind begins
        to shed rational thought, in favour of instinctive
        reaction.
        The character gains a +1 bonus to Reflex saves, a +1
        bonus to all Listen and Spot checks and a +1 bonus
        to Initiative. He suffers a -2 penalty to Intelligence,
        however, as his mind sheds its higher functions.
        Step 5 – Primal Mind
        At this step, advanced concepts such as reading,
        philosophy and debate become foreign to the
        character, as the mage begins to have difficulty
        thinking for long stretches of time. He loses focus
        rapidly, becomes forgetful, and has a hard time
        grasping the basics of sentient existence.
        The character suffers a -2 penalty to all Intelligence-
        based skill checks.
        Step 6 – Guttural Voice
        The high pitched shriek of change is the last remotely
        human sound the character will ever make. At this
        stage, the character loses the ability to speak more
        than a few words as his throat and mouth restructure
        themselves to become more animalistic. He grows
        a definite snout and descends into barks or howls
        within a sentence or two. Strangely, the character’s
        ability to work magic is not impeded.
        The character suffers a -2 penalty to all Charisma
        based skill checks, which stacks with previous
        penalties. Conversely, the character gains the ability
        to speak with all natural animals, at will.
        Step 7 – Beast Soul
        The character begins tearing at his own limbs as
        he succumbs to more serious changes. He shreds
        the flesh of his legs as they become shorter and
        snaps the bones in his arms as they grow longer. When the character rises again, he is changed – the
        transformations begun in the previous steps become
        more pronounced, his face grows more vulpine, his
        ears elongating and sliding towards the top of his
        head.
        The character’s mental state deteriorates rapidly
        at this state, but his animalistic instincts become
        heightened. He loses 2 points of Intelligence, but his
        bonus to Listen and Spot checks increases to +3.
        Step 8 – Chaotic Regression
        Primal energies flood the character’s body, resulting
        in a dangerous deterioration of mind and flesh. The
        chaos taint is so strong and the damage so severe that
        it is no longer met with pain. Instead, the wild surge
        of energy brings spasms of ecstasy, which flare as the
        character’s hair/fur falls out in tufts and his skin gains
        a moist sheen. Vulpine features are lost, in exchange
        for a look that resembles nothing so much as a fish
        crossed with a foetus.
        The radical changes weaken the mage’s body and he
        suffers 2 points of Constitution loss.
        Step 9 – Back to the Sea
        Shuddering in ecstasy, the character is assaulted with
        more wildfire changes. His moist flesh turn pale and
        thin, vestigial scales show in some places, while
        internal organs are visible in others. This primordial
        flesh requires constant application of water, lest it dry
        out, crack and split.
        The character must pour one litre of water over
        his body each hour or suffer 1d8 points of damage
        from cracking and peeling. He also suffers a -2
        circumstance penalty to all saves versus heat and
        dehydration. On the positive side the character gains
        the ability to breathe underwater through gills that
        appear on his neck and the character gains damage
        resistance 10/- from all water-based attacks or ooze
        attacks.
        Step 10 – Primordial Regression
        The final overload of chaos energy breaks down the
        last shreds of sentience that remain in the chaos mage. The resulting thing weeps in rapture as it sinks down
        into a greasy puddle of amoebas. The character’s
        essence is dispersed, destroying him utterly.
        The Path of Screaming
        Shadows
        Named for the practitioner’s inevitable fate, the Path
        of Screaming Shadows is one of the more subtle
        and, some would say, appealing of the Paths of
        Chaos. Certainly it is the least physically painful,
        but it is also the most seductive. As the strength of
        the chaos mage’s will increases, his physical power
        decreases dramatically. The further along the path
        he progresses, the less able the mage is to affect
        the world in any way except through magic. When
        the final transformation takes place, the character
        50
        PATHS OF CHAOS
        becomes trapped in his own shadow forever, his mind
        tied permanently to the tormentor’s rack of chaos
        sorcery. All that is left is a nearly mindless, hateful
        shadow, a wailing spectre mourning the loss of its
        body.
        Step 1 – Mask of Shadows
        Chaos gathers about the character like night, forever
        marking him as a creature of the dark and of the
        shadow. No matter how the light falls, the mage’s
        face is always cast in deepest shadow. Even beneath
        the noonday sun, the chaos mage attracts shadows to
        his face, leaving him in unnerving dimness.
        Step 2 – Tenebrous Will
        Benefiting from the power of chaos, the mage’s
        willpower surges even as his physical strength fades. Simple activities become tiring and more difficult
        and even walking across the room is a noticeable
        physical drain. Shadows tend to gather more deeply
        where the chaos mage walks, pooling around him like
        a tattered cloak.
        The chaos mage’s physical Strength is decreased by
        2, while his Charisma is increased by 2.
        Step 3 – Shadowed Strength
        More shadows cling to the chaos mage, darkening
        his appearance and leaving no doubt as to his
        supernatural nature. The shadows seem to feed on
        the mage’s physical strength, sapping his energy
        even further and leaving him ever more exhausted. The mage finds himself unable to accomplish once-
        simple tasks, and any burden leaves him breathless. Simultaneously, he gains the ability to see in darkness
        as easily as he sees in full daylight.
        His Strength score is reduced by 2 more points but he
        gains darkvision to a range of 30 feet (or his existing
        darkvision is increased by the same amount).
        Step 4 – Spectral Exchange
        Shadows cling to the mage’s hands like cobwebs
        in a dark corner, and he seems insubstantial when
        exposed to bright light. His terrifying presence is
        enhanced yet again, causing others to view him with
        both awe and fear.
        The character gains a +2 bonus to all Intimidate skill
        checks and a +2 circumstance bonus to Hide checks.
        Step 5 – Clinging Gloom
        More darkness gathers about the mage, and anything
        he touches seems to fade and darken as though
        swathed in deepest shadow, an effect which remains
        for some time after he sets the object down. Where
        the mage stands, shadows grow unnaturally deep and
        a palpable chill radiates from his form.
        Those with 10 feet of the mage gain a +2 circumstance
        bonus to Hide skill checks. The mage suffers a -1
        penalty to all actions, saves and caster checks, when
        fully exposed to daylight.
        Step 6 – Touch of Twilight
        In gathering darkness, the chaos mage perseveres. As
        his body continues to fail, his willpower increases. Others can see the commanding presence of the
        mage, cloaked in shadows and his physical weakness
        is equally apparent.
        The character loses 2 points of both Strength and
        Constitution and gains 2 points of Wisdom.
        Step 7 – Feeble Grasp
        Chaos surges through the character’s body, gradually
        transforming more and more of him into living
        shadow. The change leaves the character weaker
        than ever before, and his skin becomes so translucent
        and smoky that in bright light it is possible to see
        right through his extremities. At this point along
        the path, chaos truly begins to take hold of his mind;
        he becomes monomaniacal and dominating, using
        his magic to unleash ever more outlandish displays
        51
        PATHS OF CHAOS
        of force. Many become convinced that they have
        become gods or demigods, and act accordingly.
        During daylight hours, the character’s Strength is
        reduced by 2 – should this be enough to reduce his
        Strength to 0, he falls into a coma until such time
        as darkness falls. The mage now benefits from a +2
        bonus to all Move Silently checks as his mass is not
        what it once was. He also gains a +2 bonus to Will
        saves, but only during the hours between sunset and
        sunrise.
        Step 8 – Blood of Shadows
        The chaos mage’s physical self is nearly gone,
        leaving naughtt but dim shadow. When the character
        suffers injury, he bleeds flickering, hissing plumes of
        shadow instead of blood and he radiates a noticeable
        chill, cold enough to freeze water in just a few
        minutes time.
        The mage gains immunity to non-magical cold,
        and resistance equal to his class level to magical
        cold spells and spell like effects. He also loses an
        additional 2 points of Strength.
        Step 9 – Ghostly Flesh
        Chaos increases the insubstantial nature of the chaos
        mage’s body, giving his flesh a ghostly appearance
        – he is almost literally a shadow of himself. Normal
        weapons tend to pass right through him without
        injuring him and he is completely immune to cold.
        The chaos mage gains damage reduction 20/magic
        and is completely immune to both non-magical and
        magical cold. He no longer ages and need not eat or
        drink. He suffers an additional 2 points loss to both
        Strength and Constitution, and dies (as though he had
        taken the tenth step on this path) should either fall to
        0.
        Step 10 – Cathedral of Shade
        Shadow consumes the mage and he is finally, fully
        consumed. Only his shadow, its mind wracked by
        the torturous writhing of primal chaos, remains and
        that only for moments. The instant the character
        takes this final step, his body dissolves into a cloud of
        shadows, which settles like a film over everything in
        the nearby area. The character is forever lost.
        The Path of Shrieking
        Pain
        Pain is a constant companion for some chaos mages. Those who tread this path come to understand pain
        in all its myriad, horrific forms. Those on the Path
        of Pain suffer greater harm with each step as chaos
        energy flays flesh from bones, shreds skin and tears
        apart the nervous system. The path culminates with
        the chaos mage entering an endless cycle of torture,
        locked away in a pocket plane he can never escape.
        Step 1 – Flesh of the Martyr
        The power of raw chaos infuses the practitioner’s
        outer tissues while stimulating the production of
        vital fluids. The mage’s skin becomes more delicate
        than the finest paper and tears with the slightest
        movement. Sensation is heightened tenfold and any
        touch becomes a test of endurance. Even standing
        is painful, while sitting or lying on anything save
        silk or satin is pure torment. The chaos mage bleeds
        constantly, in thin streams of changing colours.
        He does gain a +4 bonus on any check that requires
        an extremely sensitive sense of touch.
        Step 2 – Scabs of Decay
        The increasing influence of raw chaos damages
        the character’s immune system. Any wound he
        suffers heals improperly, leaving a decaying scab
        which clings to the character for weeks. Even slight
        scratches or bruises result in nasty looking scars that
        leak pus.
        The character’s unsightly appearance causes a –1
        penalty to all Charisma-based checks
        Step 3 – Unwholesome Vitality
        The power of chaos rips through the character’s
        nervous system, enhancing every sensation while
        infusing him with incredible will and unnatural pain
        thresh holds. This gives him the ability to sustain
        more damage than before, by allowing him to suffer
        greater amounts of pain before succumbing.
        The chaos mage gains 2 + 1d4 hit points and gains a
        +2 bonus to all Fortitude saves.
        Step 4 – Seeping Boils
        Festering sores, filled with squirming parasites, form
        on the chaos magician’s flesh, periodically bursting
        and forming anew on what few healthy patches
        52
        PATHS OF CHAOS
        of skin remain. Horrid symbiotes take up
        residence in the character’s body cavities,
        emitting foul fluids which leak from any orifice
        and spawning strange young.
        The character suffers 2 points of Constitution
        loss as his bodily fluids are drained away
        through the stinking boils. He gains a +4
        bonus to resist pain of any sort, as his personal
        torment is far greater than anything other
        people can inflict upon him.
        Step 5 – Agonised Healing
        Increasing damage and nervous hypersensitivity
        finally catch up with and overwhelm the
        caster’s strange vitality. The chaos mage
        requires three more hours of sleep than normal
        to be considered to have received full rest,
        as he is constantly buffeted by suffering and
        terrifying nightmares of relentless torment.
        While his will have been ground down, his
        body is now a thing of chaos magic and if he receives
        his full amount of sleep, his body can make full use
        of that force. Provided he receives full rest, the chaos
        mage heals much faster than normal, recovering 1d4
        hits points per character level each day. On the other
        hand, failure to receive the needed amount of sleep
        prevents the chaos mage from healing at all and
        results in a -1 circumstance penalty to all rolls made
        during the following day.
        Step 6 – Unhealing Wounds
        The tiny tears of the Flesh of the Martyr now become
        gaping rents, the unnatural wounds quickly becoming
        home to more foul parasites which writhe visibly in
        the wounds and under the skin. These wounds heal
        quickly, but new ones open just as fast, leaving the
        chaos mage in a constant state of suffering.
        The constant agony leaves the character distracted at
        all times, so much so that he suffers a -2 penalty to all
        Concentration checks and a -1 penalty to all Reflex
        saving throws.
        Step 7 – Spectral Flensing
        The forces of chaos are now such a part of the
        character’s body that they gather invisibly around
        him after casting and strip the flesh from his bones. Completion of each spell leads to shrieking torment
        that would slay any normal person, but simply adds
        to the mage’s torment.
        The chaos mage’s suffers a –1 penalty to Will
        and Fortitude saves from the constant agony and
        fleshstripping, but he also gains a virtual immunity to
        physical torment. He is considered to have damage
        reduction 5/-.
        Step 8 – Chaotic Bleeding
        The character’s fluid system goes into overdrive
        as cellular mutations cause by raw chaos force it
        into frenzied activity. The character’s system is so
        overcharged that any time the chaos mage suffers real
        damage, he spurts unnatural amounts of blood.
        The character suffers an additional 1d4 points of
        damage every time he sustains a wound. By this
        point the mage’s personal torment is paramount. Any torture, spells or effects that inflict physical or
        mental pain will not affect the mage in any way other
        than damage (i.e. hit point or ability score loss will
        remain, but the psychological damage is ignored).
        Step 9 – Razor Bones
        Every bone in the caster’s body gains a blade
        sharp edge that saws away at surrounding tissues
        and occasionally slices through the surface of his
        skin. Even the furious activity of his unwholesome
        constitution is insufficient to completely keep up with
        this destruction.
        53
        PATHS OF CHAOS
        The chaos mage suffers 2 points of Constitution
        loss as his body slowly cuts itself to pieces. Anyone
        grappling the character or striking him with a natural
        or unarmed attack will take 1d8 points of damage per
        round of contact.
        Step 10 – Ceaseless Torture
        With a scream capable of driving a strong man
        instantly mad, black energies tear a hole in the
        universe, sucking the chaos mage into a pocket
        plane submerged deep in the river of chaos. The
        mage is beyond saving, lost in an endless loop of
        indescribable agony until the end of the universe.
        The Path of Teratic
        Progeny
        Chaos is found in the growth of all living things and,
        in some cases, chaos causes such growth. For those
        who find themselves upon this path, their bodies
        slowly transmogrify, becoming a fertile ground for
        teratic growths and tumourous pregnancies. In its
        final stages, the path leads the chaos mage toward
        his new life as a distorted womb, from which spill
        countless nightmarish and deformed children.
        Step 1 – Humps of Life
        Small lumps begin to appear just beneath the chaos
        mage’s skin. These are quite tender to the touch
        and the surrounding tissue is clearly engorged with
        blood.
        Step 2 – The Eyes of a Child
        Roughly one-half of the lumps on the chaos mage’s
        skin split open and begin weeping a clear, viscous
        fluid. Clearing away the fluid reveals a small eye in
        the centre of each of the lumps, perfectly formed but
        marred by a thick cataract over the pupil. These eyes
        are clear after a day or so of weeping, after which
        covering them causes the chaos mage a great deal of
        pain.
        The additional partial perception granted adds a
        +1 bonus to any Spot checks – providing they are
        uncovered. However, the disgust anyone will display
        upon seeing them will inflict a –1 penalty to all
        Diplomacy checks whilst they are uncovered.
        Step 3 – Vomitous Resilience
        The other half of the lumps found beneath the chaos
        mage’s skin burst open, revealing tiny mouths lined
        with chalky teeth and filled with forked tongues. Whenever the chaos mage suffers damage, these
        mouths vomit up chunks of damaged flesh in a stew
        of vile-smelling fluid.
        The vomiting mouths endow the benefit of converting
        2 hit points of damage from any physical attack the
        chaos mage suffers into nonlethal damage.
        Step 4 – Babe’s Cries
        The mouths that opened on the flesh of the chaos
        mage begin mewling and loudly clicking their teeth
        at random times. The creatures are so uncomfortable
        that wearing anything except loose robes is highly
        painful.
        This wailing causes a –2 penalty for any Hide or
        Move Silently skill checks the chaos mage makes. He also doubles the armour check penalty and arcane
        spell failure of any armour worn.
        Step 5 – Tears of Venom
        The opened eyes begin weeping more copiously,
        releasing thick, cloudy streams of fluid from the
        chaos mage’s flesh. Though disgusting to see, this
        fluid actually helps the chaos mage by removing
        toxins from his system at a much faster rate than
        normal.
        This provides the chaos mage with a +2 bonus to
        any Fortitude saves made to resist poison. The
        freakish growths now stretch onto his face, so it no
        longer possible to hide his deformity – the penalty to
        Diplomacy checks is increased to –3.
        Step 6 – Freakish Gestation
        The teratic growths within the chaos mage’s body
        begin to mature, draining away his vitality as they
        accelerate toward birth. They are never still anymore,
        continuously rippling underneath the chaos mage’s
        clothes.
        The chaos mage must consume three times as much
        food and water each day as he would normally
        require and suffers the loss of 2 points of Constitution
        and 2 points of Charisma. Bizarrely, the mage’s
        physical transformations now grant him a +1 bonus
        to all caster-level checks to use Transformation
        effects on any living creature other than himself – he
        understands the processes of mutation far better than
        anyone could possibly imagine…
        54
        PATHS OF CHAOS
        Step 7 – Gestative Coma
        The eyes from Steps 2 and 5 of the path close and are
        sealed with a thick crust of black mucous. Even if
        cleared way, this substance reforms within moments,
        keeping the eyes sealed as they enter the final stages
        of their development.
        Unfortunately, this means that the bonuses gained
        from Eyes of a Child and Tears of Venom are no
        longer available to the chaos mage. All penalties
        remain in place, however.
        Step 8 – Chaotic Gravidity
        The body of the chaos mage begins to swell to
        nightmarish proportions, reducing his ability to move
        and sapping him of his strength. The teratic mouths
        are still active – indeed, they become voracious in
        their appetite for anything they can bite.
        The teratic children growing within his body are
        so large now that he suffers a loss of 2 points of
        Dexterity and 2 points of Constitution. However,
        anyone attacking the chaos mage with an unarmed
        attack will automatically take 1d6 points of piercing
        damage as the mouths sink their teeth in….
        Step 9 – Squirming Ejecta
        The first horrific births take place as the sections
        of the chaos mage’s body burst open to eject thick,
        wriggling creatures formed from waste tissue and
        chaotic energy. These creatures live only moments
        before their horrific forms collapse into reeking
        scraps of corrupted flesh and oily liquids.
        1d4 of these creatures are birthed each day, causing
        1d6 hit points of damage to the chaos mage each
        time. While the damage caused by their births can
        be healed, this is offset by the loss of an additional 2
        points of Constitution when this step is gained. The
        chaos mage’s bonus to all caster-level checks to use
        Transformation effects on any living creature other
        than himself is increased to +3.
        Step 10 – Womb of Madness
        The chaos mage’s entire body is disrupted and
        reformed to operate as a womb for all manner of
        chaotic creatures. Horrific beasts, all with Hit Dice
        equal to or less than the chaos mage’s level at the
        time of his transformation, emerge wriggling from
        his bleeding birth canal to rampage across the earth.
        The Path of Tortured
        Stone
        Those who find themselves on this path tend to have a
        strong connection to earth, rock and stone. Dwarves
        are especially susceptible to this path, though those
        who make their living among the rocks, such as
        miners, masons and sculptors, also succumb easily
        to its siren call, their bodies and souls hardened, until
        nothing remains but living, agonised stone.
        Step 1 – Tears of Stone
        The character’s eyes burn and itch, then begin
        weeping small, oily pebbles slightly larger than
        normal teardrops. These fall endlessly from his eyes
        in a slow avalanche, revealing him as marked by
        chaos to all who care to look. Should the character
        not take precautions, he will leave an easily followed
        trail of pebbles behind him as he moves.
        Step 2 – Face of Marble
        A chilly hardening sensation accompanies the
        changes this step brings. The character’s skin is
        covered in thick, marble like striations, his eyes
        become flat and lifeless; his facial muscles lose their
        expressiveness. Changes begin in his soul as well, as
        his emotions are suppressed and hidden away.
        The character gains a +1 natural Armour Class bonus
        and his ‘poker face’ gives him a +1 bonus to Bluff
        checks. His slowed reflexes inflict a –2 penalty to
        Initiative, however.
        Step 3 – Scabs of Earth
        Thick streams of sludge are exuded from the chaos
        mage’s flesh, solidifying into brittle plates on the
        surface of his skin. Scabs and sludge are also exuded
        from his hands, staining anything he touches and
        making fine motor control difficult. The material
        flakes off easily, but the incessant dripping coats flesh
        again in just moments.
        The character loses 2 points of Dexterity, but his
        natural Armour Class increases to +2.
        Step 4 – Stone Limbs
        Icy chills run deep inside the mage as threads of
        chaos solidify into crystalline structures within his
        arms and legs, emerging from his skin as strangely
        coloured protrusions. These crystal ridges are potent
        weapons and also serve to further protect the chaos
        mage.
        55
        PATHS OF CHAOS
        At this level of ‘evolution’, the character begins to
        find the idea of movement foreign, and he will happily
        sit immobile for hours, with no hint of motion. His
        thoughts, run quiet and deep, rumbling far beneath
        the surface like worms burrowing in dirt.
        The character’s natural Armour Class bonus increases
        to +3 and his unarmed attacks do slashing damage,
        rather than nonlethal, though he is still considered
        unarmed. Conversely, his speed is reduced by 5 feet per round, to a minimum of 10 feet per round.
        Step 5 – Eyes of Stone
        Stone tears are now joined by a crystalline layer of
        chaotic material which forms over the mage’s eyes
        and must be wiped away on a regular basis. The
        crumbling grit is obvious if the chaos mage’s eyes are
        not covered, and the detritus leaves vivid stains on the
        character’s face. The incessant distraction makes it
        difficult for the mage to concentrate on anything.
        The character suffers a -2 penalty to all Concentration
        checks. His inadvertent mental shielding now grants
        him a +2 bonus to saves against any mind-affecting
        spells or effects, but his sensory deprivation penalises
        all Listen, Search and Spot checks with a –1
        modifier.
        Step 6 – Calcified Flesh
        Shards of stone begin forming just below the surface
        of the mage’s skin. These provide some measure of
        protection, but at the cost of mobility. The calcified
        flesh begins to lose all sensation and the mage can no
        longer feel the touch of a lover, nor do burrs, thistles
        or even small injuries draw his attention.
        The character’s natural Armour Class bonus increases
        to +4, but he loses 2 more points of Dexterity.
        Step 7 – Earth Locked Joints
        Internal agony is not so easily escaped as the external. The natural covering of rock which protects the
        character becomes thicker, more intrusive and less
        easily ignored. Each movement is torture, as flesh
        must crumble, bend and, ultimately, break each time
        a limb is moved.
        The character’s movement rate decreases by another
        5 feet per round, to a minimum of 5 feet per round. In addition, he suffers a -1 penalty to all Reflex saves,
        but gains a +1 bonus to all Fortitude saves. His
        emotional withdrawal is nearly complete, however,
        inflicting a –2 penalty to all Charisma-based checks,
        but increasing his bonus to resist mind-affecting
        spells and effects by a further +2. The sheer amount
        of stone in the character’s body increases his raw
        power, granting a +2 bonus to Strength.
        Step 8 – Chaotic Spires
        Shrieking howls emanate from the character’s nearly
        still stony face as the stone laced throughout the
        mage’s body grows out of control, grinding forth
        from the character’s body in a frightening array. Crystalline spines, ranging in size from a few inches
        to a foot or more, run through his body; these spines
        serve as conductors for chaos energy, and throb
        and pulse in a sickly rainbow of colours. At
        the same time, chaos calcifies the mage’s heart,
        mind and memory, erasing the last vestiges of
        emotion, save for one last memory of horrific
        loss.
        The character loses 2 more points of Dexterity,
        and can no longer wear clothes other than loose
        robes. His fearsome appearance grants him a +4
        bonus to all Intimidation checks, however.
        Step 9 – Flowing Stone
        Chaotic backlash causes the stone lancing the
        character’s body to liquefy as it flows into strange,
        56
        PATHS OF CHAOS
        blasphemous shapes of chaotic design. All sensation
        deserts the mage as his last nerves are evaporated, his
        sight dims as his hearing is reduced to a low rumble
        of stone on stone. Emotion simply disappears and
        the practitioner suffers from a crushing, dreadful
        apathy, which only the full extent of his willpower
        can overcome.
        The chaos mage suffers a further loss of 2 points
        of Dexterity, but gains damage reduction 5/- and a
        further +1 bonus to Fortitude saves. The character ‘s
        Listen, Search and Spot checks are all inflicted with
        –2 penalty now.
        Step 10 – Pillar of Chaos
        Wild sorcery completely destroys the sanity of the
        chaos mage, reducing his body to a pile of living
        stone. The character is no longer sentient in any way
        comprehensible to mortals, and his body periodically
        merges with the earth, only to reappear in a new
        location after some random time. This change is
        permanent, and the character is irrevocably lost to
        chaos.
        The Path of Whispered
        Madness
        Those who fall onto this path suffer radical changes
        to their minds, rather than their bodies. As
        chaos weaves through their thoughts and
        fills the crevices of their minds, they will
        discover that this path is no less deadly
        than the rest. Haunted by delusions, the
        mage must inevitably succumb to madness,
        sinking down into a private hell of his own
        imagining.
        Step 1 – Whispers of Chaos
        The chaos mage begins to hear mumbling
        voices at odd times, and he may find himself
        unconsciously muttering responses to voices
        only he can hear, or cocking his head to one
        side to better hear the whispering.
        Step 2 – Chaotic Focus
        On this step along the path, the character no
        longer hears voices. Instead, he now begins
        to fear that in his madness, he has missed
        something important, so he immediately
        begins to pay much closer attention to
        his immediate surroundings, often to the
        exclusion of everything else. Planning
        becomes difficult and the mage is often distracted by
        passing butterflies or flitting shadows.
        The character gains a +2 bonus to Spot checks, but
        suffers a –2 penalty to Concentration checks.
        Step 3 – Night Messages
        The voices now return, stronger than ever, to haunt
        the chaos mage’s sleep. The voices whisper of past
        misdeeds, and future vile acts, assaulting the mage in
        the night with poisonous words that cast doubt upon
        his own actions.
        During the day, the mage is irritable but strangely
        alert, continuing to watch the tiny and great events
        around him with an intensity that is disturbing.
        The character must rest two hours longer each night
        to be considered to have received full rest.
        Step 4 – Paranoid Awareness
        The character becomes confused and hyper-attentive,
        believing the voices he has heard are coming for him
        and will soon end his life, or that they have told him
        of plots against him by friends and enemies. While
        his attention is at its peak, his paranoia will lead
        to disastrous decisions. He becomes twitchy and
        57
        PATHS OF CHAOS
        refuses to sleep, often staying awake for days at a
        time, lest the voices come and ‘get’ him.
        The character loses 2 points of Wisdom and his
        Intelligence is increased by 2. Strangely, the loss
        of Wisdom does not effect his spellcasting – he is
        considered to retain his original Wisdom score for the
        purposes of casting chaos magic.
        Step 5 – Mark of Madness
        Any character reaching this point on the Path of
        Whispered Madness is descending rapidly into
        madness, carrying on strange, animated conversations
        with phantoms and making terrifying, dire predictions
        of imminent doom. Living anything like a normal
        life is now impossible. The character is marked by
        tics and twitches, and reacts poorly to surprise.
        When the character is surprised, he is unable to act in
        the surprise round or the following round.
        Step 6 – Bleak Conclusion
        The character is now certain that his death is imminent
        and spends an inordinate amount of time watching for
        real or perceived threats. He may disappear without
        warning for days or weeks at a time, and when he
        reappears, he will hint cryptically at having evaded
        ‘them’. Conversation with the character becomes
        effectively impossible, for all but the most patient and
        understanding.
        The character suffers a -2 penalty to both his Charisma
        and his Wisdom, though again, the loss in Wisdom
        does not affect his ability to cast chaos magic.
        Step 7 – Chaotic Ravings
        Chaos mages now respond violently to their own
        illusions, shouting obscenities or speaking in
        gibberish. An obsession with the voices often leads
        to the character ignoring basic tasks such as hygiene
        and eating, further adding to his aura of insanity.
        The character gains a further +2 bonus to Intelligence
        and gains a +4 bonus against all mind-affecting spells
        and spell-like effects – chaos has a grip on his mind,
        and it is a jealous master.
        Step 8 – Preternatural Senses
        Reality now holds little interest for the mage, and
        most of his time is spent conversing with, or listening
        to, the echoes of chaos continually babbling through
        his mind. Oddly, as the character withdraws from
        reality, his awareness of minor details becomes more
        acute, even as his mind tears itself apart.
        The character gains a +2 competence bonus to Spot
        and Listen checks. However, he suffer a further –2
        penalty to Wisdom, though again, the loss in Wisdom
        does not affect his ability to cast chaos magic.
        Step 9 – Splintered Mind
        Whatever sanity the character still held crumbles
        away once this step on the path is taken. The forces
        of chaos shatter his mind irrevocably, infusing
        each shard with its own fractured personality. The
        character’s memories and skills remain, put his
        personality and capabilities constantly change,
        depending on which personality charge has clawed
        its way to the surface.
        Each day, the character loss 1d4 points randomly
        from one attribute, but also gains the same number of
        points in a different attribute. His babbling insanity
        makes it extremely hard to interact with the character
        and he cannot stop twitching – he suffers a –2 penalty
        on all Charisma and Dexterity-based skills.
        Step 10 – Hellpocket
        The final misfire of wild sorcery opens the character’s
        eyes to sanity and lucidity one last time. Then chaos
        pours forth from his body, closes around him and
        carries him away to a hell scooped from his own
        darkest imaginings. The character is irrevocably lost,
        dragged behind the veil of normality to drown in the
        river of chaos.
        The Path of the Whore
        While most chaos paths wreak havoc with the victim’s
        body and mind, the path of the whore decimates
        the mage’s moral centre instead. The chaos mage
        becomes obsessed with the concept of prostitution, in
        all its many forms, as a metaphor for the give and take
        of chaos magic. In an attempt to better understand
        his art, the chaos mage thus becomes the ultimate
        prostitute, advancing at last to become a wretched,
        cosmic whore enslaved to the will of beings beyond
        mortal understanding.
        Step 1 – Questions of Worth
        The chaos mage begins to question the value of
        everything, doing his best to categorise the actions
        of others by their ‘value’ in terms of gold, gems or
        whatever system of judging wealth he adopts.
        58
        PATHS OF CHAOS
        Step 2 – Hired Help
        The chaos mage is simply unable to do anything
        himself that he can hire someone else to do for
        him. Shining his shoes, fixing his breakfast and
        the performance of sexual favours are all things the
        chaos mage not only pays for, but prefers to pay for
        in lieu of earning them in other ways, or doing them
        himself.
        If presented with the opportunity to buy the
        services of someone, the mage must succeed at a
        Will save against a DC of 10 or be forced to take
        that opportunity, even if it would prove financially
        ruinous.
        Step 3 – Whore’s Eye
        The chaos mage is adept at judging the value of
        things, or at least their perceived value. His greed
        and lust for the act of transaction leads him to spend
        wildly on items he does not need, so long as he feels
        he is getting the better end of the deal.
        He gains a +2 bonus to all Appraise checks. Should
        he feel that the value of the item exceeds its price, he
        must purchase it, unless he succeeds at a Will save
        (DC 10). His whorish ways inflict a steady drain on
        his finances – at the end of every month he is assumed
        to lose 10% of his total wealth (including land and
        possessions).
        Step 4 – Crude Proposal
        Unable to restrain himself, the chaos mage continually
        propositions anyone he meets, always entreating them
        to perform acts which are, at best, out of character for
        them. The chaos mage cannot reliably control this
        urge, so when he meets someone for the first time,
        chances are good he will proposition them.
        The chaos mage suffers a -4 penalty to all non-player
        character reaction checks and a -2 competence
        penalty to Diplomacy checks.
        Step 5 – Seductive Offering
        After a few slaps in the face and possible legal
        entanglements, the chaos mage has learned to make
        offers that are more enticing. Still, his slavish
        devotion saps his better judgement and he is prone
        to rash acts.
        The chaos mage receives a +2 competence bonus
        to both Bluff and Sense Motive checks mage when
        attempting to convince someone to do something
        which most would consider reasonable. He loses
        2 points of Wisdom, though he uses his original
        Wisdom score when casting chaos magic effects.
        Step 6 – Gleam of Coin
        Hiring others no longer appeals to the mage, who now
        believes his handling of chaos magic has entitled the
        world to a piece of him, so long as they
        are willing to pay the price. The chaos
        mage will perform any service for a
        reasonable price, though he can refuse
        those offers which result in immediate
        personal injury.
        The character must succeed at a Will
        save against a DC of 15 to resist
        accepting any offer which is put before
        him. He is considered to automatically
        succeed if such an offer would
        result in immediate injury or death.
        His whorish ways are now severely
        draining his finances – at the end of
        every month he is assumed to lose 20%
        of his total wealth (including land and
        possessions).
        Step 7 – Obsessive Servitude
        The chaos mage begins to hire himself
        out for menial or repulsive tasks, often
        hiring himself out to a whorehouse
        59
        PATHS OF CHAOS
        The Final Fate
        If a chaos mage ever reaches the last step of any
        Path of Chaos, he is lost – irretrievably, irrevocably,
        permanently lost. There are ample opportunities for
        any chaos mage to save himself from this fate, but
        those who push too far should be made to suffer their
        ultimate punishment. Wandering adventurers may
        encounter the remnants of such chaos mages in the
        wilderness, each serving as a reminder of the price
        chaos always collects.
        Due to the explosive interaction between traditional
        magic and chaos sorcery, there are no spells that can
        bring a lost mage back from the depths of the chaos
        sea. Not even a wish or miracle is sufficient, though
        each of those spells is sufficient to move a character
        one step back along a Path of Chaos.
        Cheating Fate
        Chaos mages faced with a painful and irredeemable
        death may decide it is in their best interest to end their
        lives naturally, and pray that a raise dead, resurrection
        or similar spell can be used to restore their life – and,
        coincidentally, reset the chaotic clock which is ticking
        within their bodies.
        Unfortunately, chaos is not so easily purged or tricked. A character who dies while having taken even a single
        step along a chaos path returns to life still afflicted. The power of chaos recognise those who share its taint
        and will seek them far beyond the grave if necessary.
        or other place of demeaning, spiritually exhausting
        labour. The chaos mage must spend a minimum
        of one week a month (though not necessarily in a
        single stretch) performing this type of work, to the
        exclusion of all else.
        The character loses 2 points of Constitution and
        Strength, as the demeaning tasks wear at body and
        soul.
        Step 8 – Hireling
        The chaos mage is now incapable of performing
        actions without being hired to do so. Even his
        companions must make reasonable offers of pay if
        they wish the chaos mage to assist them. The chaos
        mage simply will not perform work of any sort
        without recompense.
        His apparently heartless greed means that he has to be
        paid in order to perform any service. Diplomacy and
        Sense Motive checks are all made with a –2 penalty
        as the character loses his ability to empathise.
        Step 9 – Soul of the Slave
        The chaos mage has little will of his own at this point,
        but will offer his services to any who pay even the
        feeblest sums. Those who know his condition can
        prey upon him, as offering him a copper piece to
        sever a finger seems just as reasonable to his addled
        mind as would a request to shine a lord’s shoes.
        The chaos mage suffers a -2 penalty to all Will saves. His whorish ways have now permanently crippled his
        finances – at the end of every month he is assumed
        to lose 40% of his total wealth (including land and
        possessions). On the other hand, he has become
        as renowned as the Whore of Babylon and will
        undoubtedly have an entourage of (foolish) followers
        – he gains the Leadership feat. If he already has this
        feat, he gains a +4 bonus to his Leadership Score.
        Step 10 – Whore of Chaos
        The chaos mage offers his body and soul up to the
        forces of chaos, the mindless and seething energies
        which lie beyond mortal ken. Sadly, they hear and
        accept his offer, snatching him away and amusing
        themselves with his puny mortal existence for a few
        generations, then casting him aside like a despoiled
        rag doll. The character’s soul is ruptured horribly and
        expires immediately.
        60
        CHAOS SORCERY
        Chaos
        Sorcery
        I don’t remember the first time I used my powers,
        any more than I remember my first breath. The
        power has always been with me, or, at least, it
        seems that way, though I confess exposure to chaos
        energies may have addled my memory further than I
        am prepared to admit.
        My mother and her people called me ‘kallakazoak’,
        which translates loosely as sorcerer in the tribal
        tongue. Or perhaps, more precisely, as the bringer
        of blasphemous magic. I myself prefer the term
        ‘kallanaostra’, or bringer of great change; the old
        man taught me that, and I far prefer it to the first
        name, as you might imagine.
        Still, I must admit that the first name holds a bit
        of truth. My magic, our magic, is blasphemous,
        at least to those staid folk who insist that magic is
        naught but rote memorisation and recitation and
        transcribing and formulae and chanting and finger
        wiggling; I had quite my fill of that at the University. Well, save for the finger wiggling, we did precious
        little of that, even in seminary, though our chanting
        made up for it, I’m quite sure.
        But I digress. Our magic is blasphemous, but only
        to their sensibilities, and only because of their
        preconceptions and prejudices. Why should that
        matter to us? Our magic is not evil, our use of it not
        misguided, our intentions noble as any, if we choose
        it to be so, or base and cruel, as our whims and
        conscience decide.
        And that is as it should be.
        The nature of chaos is not endless change,
        though it may seem otherwise. Constant,
        unceasing change is predictable, it is
        understandable, it is its own form of order and just
        as much the antithesis of chaos as immutable, static
        sameness is. Indeed, chaos mages often refer to
        their counterparts’ arcane tinkerings as ‘static’ magic
        – as opposed to true wild chaos magic. By the same
        token, chaos mages will sometimes refer to their
        magical effects as ‘weaves’ rather than the more staid
        description of ‘spells’.
        No, the true nature of chaos is endless possibility,
        layer upon infinite layer of potential outcomes, each
        no more or no less likely to occur than any other and
        each peeled and cast away, forgotten, at the moment
        of choosing, like the dry skin of an onion.
        So it is with chaos sorcery. Chaos magicians can use
        their control of chaos energy to cast spells with a near
        infinite number of permutations, limited only by their
        imagination and their strength of will. Even a novice
        chaos mage is more versatile than his bard, sorcerer,
        and wizard peers, and a powerful chaos mage could
        conceivably weave a hundred spells each day and
        never cast the same one twice.
        This chapter is the heart of The Quintessential Chaos
        Mage, presenting the full rules necessary to bring
        chaos magic into new or ongoing fantasy campaigns. The information on the following pages will lead
        you, step-by-step, through the creation of a chaos
        magic effect, from choosing the initial effect to the
        actual casting of the spell. Each step along the way
        will lay out all the relevant mechanics in an easy to
        follow fashion, so that, like the chaos mage himself,
        you will quickly learn how to create spells on the fly.
        A number of sample spells, of all power levels, are
        also presented in this chapter, immediately following
        the rules for creating chaos magic effects. These
        spells, while by no means a comprehensive listing,
        should serve as good examples of the kinds of effects
        which can be created using the free-form chaos
        magic rules.
        While the incredible variety of this system may seem
        daunting at first, with a little effort and some practice,
        the creation and casting of chaos spell effects will
        become second nature, both to the character and the
        player.
        Step-By-Step
        What follows are the basic instructions for choosing
        and casting chaos magic effects. Each step lays out
        all the options and choices available to the character,
        and to the player, allowing him to make informed
        choices.

        CHAOS SORCERY
        The Freeform Nature of Chaos Sorcery
        The strength of chaos magic, both in-game and
        from a mechanical standpoint, is its versatility. Unfortunately, the sheer open-endedness of chaos
        magic can sometimes lead to creative paralysis, with
        both players and Games Masters so spoiled for choice
        that they are unable to decide which spell effect is
        correct for the given situation. This can bog down
        your gaming sessions, with what should be exciting
        adventure scenes slowed to a crawl by the minutiae of
        determining the perfect combination of effects and the
        ideal balance of risk versus reward in chaos spell check
        DCs. We’ve mitigated this by including a breakdown
        of how to cast chaos spells on the character sheets at
        the back of this book for easy reference. Nevertheless,
        it is likely that your game will suffer somewhat from
        this phenomenon when you first introduce chaos magic
        to your campaign; new rules always take time to break
        in and these are no exception. Should the slowdown
        continue beyond the first handful of game sessions,
        however you might wish to do the following:
        Prepare spell effects ahead of time: Just because you
        can create spell effects on the fly, does not mean you
        have to. There is nothing wrong with creating a handful
        of default spell effects to reference in those times when
        imagination and inspiration fail. Alternately, you
        can look to existing arcane spells to provide direct
        inspiration – there is no reason a chaos mage cannot or
        should not throw fireballs with the same abandon his
        wizard counterparts do.
        Work as a team: Though adventuring and gaming is
        a group effort, party members and individual players
        usually do not, and should not, direct each other in
        the use of their, or their character’s, skills, feats and
        abilities. When first learning how to use these rules,
        you might want to encourage each other to do just that. Several sets of eyes, and several brains, all looking
        at different sections of the new rules can speed up
        decision making considerably. Just remember that
        it is the chaos mage’s player who must ultimately be
        allowed to make final decisions for his character – the
        rest of the group are advisors, not bosses.
        Impose a temporary time limit: Should all else fail,
        the Games Master might wish to impose a loose time
        limit on the chaos mage player. A starting deadline
        of three to five minutes gives the player enough time
        to consider his options, while still ensuring he cannot
        delay the game too long. Should the deadline pass
        without commitment from the player, then the Games
        Master should simply rule that the character was too
        wracked by indecisiveness in the heat of battle to
        contribute this round. A kind Games Master might
        allow the player to either select another action for his
        character, or default to the spell he last cast.
        Each option is presented in the following fashion:
        Effect Descriptor – the name of the effect.
        Casting DC – the number added to the total DC of
        the spell, which must be overcome by a chaos mage’s
        casting check to successfully cast the spell.
        Save – The saving throw permitted to overcome or
        reduce the effect, if applicable.
        Spell Resistance – if applicable.
        Continued Concentration – Whether the effect
        requires the chaos mage to concentrate throughout
        the effect’s duration or not.
        Effect Description – specific details of the effect,
        including relevant mechanics.
        There are six steps to creating and, ultimately, casting
        a chaos magic spell. An overview of each step is
        listed below, with an in-depth presentation of each
        immediately following the overview.
        Step Overview
        Step 1: Choose an Element Effect
        All chaos magic spells have a final effect and this
        final effect is what you will select first. Do you
        want to burn your enemies with fire? Teleport miles
        outside their grasp? Or do you wish to charm them
        into submission? You will decide that here.
        Step 2: Choose an Area of Effect Element
        All chaos magic spell effects have a designated area
        of effectl, from effects that target only the caster or
        another individual, to spells which encompass wide
        swathes of terrain or hordes of beings.
        Step 3: Choose a Range Element
        All chaos magic spells require a range element. While it is relatively simple for a chaos mage to use
        an effect against a target right in front of him, he does
        not have to. A skilled chaos mage can launch effects
        across a distance of miles.
        Step 4: Choose a Duration Element
        Most chaos magic effects are instantaneous, with
        the effects occurring and then ending, in the space
        between breaths. Should he choose to, however, a
        chaos mage can weave effects that last for minutes,
        or even hours. There is no way for a chaos mage to
        create a permanent effect, though, as the nature of
        chaos is to avoid stagnation.

        CHAOS SORCERY
        Clarifications and Expansions
        The rules presented below incorporate both
        the original chaos magic spell rules from
        Encyclopaedia Arcana: Chaos Magic and the
        clarifications and errata from the Chaos Magic
        web enhancement. In all cases, the rules
        presented here supersede those presented in the
        aforementioned books.
        Step 5: Choose a Saving Throw Element
        There are many magical defences to thwart
        spellcasters, but the chaos mage has the unique
        ability to overwhelm them through sheer weight of
        chaos energy. This step is where he can decide to do
        so, at the cost of making his spell much more difficult
        to cast.
        Step 6: Casting the Spell
        The final step in the creation process is the actual
        casting of the chaos magic spell. To cast the spell,
        the player should add together the DC numbers
        received by selecting options in steps one through
        five. The total of these numbers is the final DC which
        must be overcome by the chaos mage with a caster
        check to successfully cast the effect. If the check is
        successful, the spell goes off as expected, subject to
        the vagaries of its interacting with the target and other
        spell effects.
        While the casting will be discussed in greater detail
        later, it is worth noting that the casting check to
        successfully cast a chaos magic spell is
        Chaos mage’s class level + Wisdom bonus + 1d20 vs the total spell effect DC
        It has been mentioned before, but it bears repeating
        here: Games Masters and players alike should spend
        some time reviewing and familiarising themselves
        with the rules presented in this chapter, to better
        speed their integration into the campaign.
        Step 1: Choose an
        Element Effect
        All chaos mage spells have an effect element. An
        effect element is a fancy name for a spell’s purpose,
        which is why we say all spells have an effect element
        and why choosing it is Step One – if there is no
        purpose to be achieved, then there is no need for a
        spell to be cast.
        As befits this first, most important step, there are
        quite a number of options for the player to choose
        from. The list below describes each of these options
        in full and provides full rules for their use.
        Direct Damage
        Effects
        The most straightforward tool in the chaos mage’s
        arsenal, a damage effect is a simple expulsion of
        chaos energy, a twisting, ravenous burst that strips
        away sanity, flesh and the bonds of reality with equal
        facility. Injuries created with a damage effect tend to
        be horrific, with even those spells crafted to replicate
        the effects of fire or ice leaving the targeted flesh
        bloated with corruption – injuries inflicted by chaos
        damage effects are horrific to look upon, greasy and
        covered with pustules that scream and moan before
        fading to quiescence.

        CHAOS SORCERY
        What Chaos Magic Cannot Do
        Chaos magic is extraordinarily versatile and an
        imaginative chaos mage can weave strands of
        chaos in thousands of different combinations,
        allowing him to achieve almost any result, as his
        whims and necessity dictate. Still, chaos magic is
        not without its limits, and there are certain broad
        categories of magical effects that it simply cannot
        produce.
        Healing Magic
        Chaos magic can twist flesh, sculpt bone and
        cause uncontrolled growth; it can seize control of
        the brain’s electrical impulses, shatter thoughts,
        turn friends to lovers and then to bitterest rivals;
        it can even create the semblance of life from pure
        ambient chaos; but it cannot heal a scratch, cannot
        return cancerous flesh to pure, or restore life to
        the fallen. In short, chaos magic cannot be used
        to restore hit points.
        Divination Magic
        Chaos magic is wholly unsuitable for prediction,
        prognostication, retrocognition or divinations of
        any sorts. Chaos is the infinite possibilities of the
        now and it is not in its nature to predict the future
        or read the past. Chaos magic cannot be used to
        create any magic which reads the future or reveals
        past events.
        Summoning
        While chaos energy can be used to create living
        constructs of chaos matter, or weave spells that
        command the minds of monsters and beasts, or
        even shift monsters from one place to another, it is
        not possible for chaos magic to directly summon
        monsters.
        That is to say, chaos magic cannot be used to
        replicate the effects of a summon monster or
        summon nature’s ally spells. There are a few ways
        around this, however. For example, a chaos mage
        can seize control of an existing beast, directing
        it to attack or flee, as he sees fit. Alternately, he
        could use Movement effects to teleport nearby
        creatures into the thick of enemy formations (and
        can use similar magic to bring specific creatures
        he knows well, such as trained dogs, from much
        greater distances). In short, this is a limitation a
        clever chaos mage can overcome.
        All damage effects impose a -1 penalty to saving
        throws made by lawfully aligned beings. Conversely,
        chaotic beings gain a +1 bonus to saving throws made
        to resist damage effects.
        Raw Damage Effect
        Casting DC: 10
        Save: Fort half
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continued Concentration: No
        Raw Damage is the most straightforward effect
        a chaos mage can produce, a simple expulsion of
        violent energy directed at one or more targets. Raw
        Damage is subtle as a hammer to the face, but also an
        effective as... a hammer to the face. Raw Damage
        effect spells inflict 1d8 points of damage per caster
        level, though a chaos mage can intentionally choose
        to inflict less damage.
        Persistent Damage Effect
        Casting DC: 5
        Save: Fort half
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continued Concentration: Yes
        Rather than create a spell effect which instantaneously
        delivers all its damage, a chaos mage can choose to
        craft a spell which causes a gradually escalating
        amount of damage, until it reaches its full potential
        over several rounds’ time. Spells of this effect
        element take longer to deliver damage, but are
        easier to cast than single blasts of chaos energy. The
        Persistent Damage effect causes a single 1d8 points
        of damage upon the target, or targets, in the round
        that it is cast, with the damage increasing by 1d8 on
        each subsequent round until all available damage has
        been dealt. Persistent Damage spells inflict a total
        of 1d8 per caster level, as Direct Damage spells do,
        though a chaos mage can of course choose to do less
        damage.
        Another advantage of persistent spell effects is that
        the victim is required to attempt a new save each
        round he receives damage. The result of each save,
        positive or negative, applies only to the damage
        inflicted that round.
        To make record keeping easier, it is recommended
        that the chaos mage’s player set aside a number
        of dice equal to the damage dealt by the Persistent
        Damage effect, removing and rolling dice from the
        pool each round. When the final dice have been
        rolled, the spell is complete.
        64
        CHAOS SORCERY
        For example: A 6th level chaos mage casts a persistent
        spell at an unsuspecting ogre. The spell inflicts just
        1d8 points of damage in the first round, with the ogre
        saving for half damage immediately. In the second
        round, the spell inflicts 2d8 points of damage, with
        the ogre saving against the damage as before. In the
        third round, the spell inflicts 3d8 damage, and the
        ogre rolls to save one final time. The third round
        is the final round of spell duration, as the spell has
        inflicted a total of 6d8 of damage, and thus there are
        no more dice of damage to inflict. Had the chaos
        mage been 7th level, In the fourth round the spell
        would have inflicted a single die of damage, for a
        total of 7d8.
        Persistent Damage effects need not be combined
        with a By Round Duration element. They continue
        to inflict normal damage each round, until their limit
        is reached as normal.
        Degrading Damage Effect
        Casting DC: 10
        Save: Fort half
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continued Concentration: Yes
        Spells of this effect deliver an initial blast of arcane
        energy which lingers for multiple rounds, inflicting
        a reduced amount of harm each round until it
        dissipates.
        In the first round, the spell does one-half the caster’s
        chaos mage level in d8s of damage, one die less than
        that in the following round, then continues to drop by
        1d8 per round after that until no more dice remain. As with a Persistent Damage effect, the victim is
        required to make a new save each round, with the
        results applying only to the damage inflicted in that
        round.
        Degrading Damage effect is very powerful, with the
        potential to inflict a great deal of damage. Still, it has
        its limits and no spell using the Degrading Damage
        effect can ever inflict more than 30d8 total damage. In addition, while a chaos mage using Degrading
        Damage spells can potentially inflict more damage
        than with a Direct Damage spell, he may not get
        the chance to – the retaliation from an enemy who
        survives the halved first round of damage could be
        enough to disrupt the chaos mage’s concentration or
        kill him outright, ending the spell prematurely.
        For example: A 10th level chaos mage casts a
        Degrading Damage effect on a small dragon. In the
        first round, the spell inflicts 5d8 damage, or half the
        total potential damage of the spell. In the second
        round, the spell inflicts one die less damage, or 4d8. In the third round it inflicts 3d8, in the fourth 2d8,
        and in the fifth and final round, 1d8 points of damage. The total damage inflicted is 5d8 + 4d8 + 3d8 + 2d8
        + 1d8 = 15d8 damage.
        Degrading Damage effects must be combined with
        a By Round Duration element, or they dissipate
        immediately upon inflicting the first round of
        damage.
        Nonlethal Damage Effect
        Casting DC: +2
        Using damaging spell energy to subdue, rather
        than slay, requires subtlety, finesse and restraint. Unfortunately, chaos is not so easily restrained. Any
        of the damage effects listed above can be altered to
        inflict nonlethal, rather than killing, damage, but the
        base casting DC is increased by +2.
        Personal Immunity Effect
        Casting DC: +2
        It simply would not do for a chaos mage to fall victim
        to his own chaos energies, or at least, not more often
        then he already does. Adding personal immunity
        to his damage inflicting spells allows him to centre
        explosions of chaos on himself, which is very handy
        for destroying foes who dare come too close.
        Damage Causing Spells, Elemental
        Energies and Strange Effects
        Spells that make use of the damage effect element
        generate vivid visual effects that are unique to the
        individual caster. Any sort of visual or sensory
        effect is possible, from shrieking, flaming demons
        soaring about the caster’s hands, to columns of
        flame which surround him like a corona, to sudden
        flurries of crystalline blue glass shards which pop
        and crackle and then burst like fattened ticks, but the
        visual effects, no matter what form they take, have no
        in-game mechanical effect. The player and Games
        Master should work together to come up with an
        appropriate visual hook for the character, at the time
        of creation.
        65
        CHAOS SORCERY
        Normally, chaos magic damage effects inflict force
        damage. If the caster wills it, however, the damage
        inflicted can be changed to fire, cold, electric, sonic
        or acid. To alter the damage type in this fashion
        increases the casting DC by +1.
        Domination Effects
        Chaos magicians can use their mastery of chaos to
        bend and change the perceptions of those around
        them. At the lowest levels, chaos magic can force
        victims to undertake actions they would not normally
        consider, while the most powerful chaos effects can
        completely rearrange the target’s mental pathways,
        altering their personalities and very souls, on a
        fundamental level.
        Generally, Domination effects are considered mind-
        affecting spell effects. With the Games Master’s
        permission, and with suitable justification and
        explanation, a player could conceivably invent an
        effect which is not mind-affecting.
        Negligible Effect
        Casting DC: 5
        Save: Will negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continuous Concentration: No
        A Negligible Domination effect is a bit of mental
        sleight of hand, a soft nudge able to influence, but
        not control, a target. A Negligible Domination effect
        can be used to create the following effects, as well as
        others:
        A Negligible Domination effect can cause a target,
        or targets, to involuntarily speak one word for every
        class level the chaos mage possesses. The victims
        can be forced to speak any words, in any language
        that either the caster or the victim knows, but they
        cannot be forced to utter words which cause magical
        effects, such as verbal components. If multiple
        victims are affected by the spells, they can only be
        forced to speak the same phrase, or phrases. Once the
        target has spoken the words, there is nothing stopping
        them from immediately denying what was said – save
        another Domination effect.
        66
        CHAOS SORCERY
        A Negligible Domination effect can impose an
        enhancement bonus or penalty on an Intelligence,
        Wisdom, or Charisma-based skill check. The penalty
        or bonus is equal to +1 or -1 per two class levels, to a
        maximum of +/-5.
        A Negligible effect can create over-confidence in
        a target, or targets, causing them to neglect their
        defence against ‘inferior’ opponents, suffering a -1
        penalty to their Armour Class per 2 caster levels, to a
        maximum -5 penalty.
        A Negligible Domination effect can inspire trust or
        distrust. A successful casting can impose a bonus
        or penalty to non-player character reaction checks,
        equal to +1 or -1 per two caster levels, to a maximum
        of +/-5.
        Minor Effect
        Casting DC: 10
        Save: Will Negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continuous Concentration: No
        Minor Domination effects are more insidious
        than Negligible effects and are capable of, albeit
        temporarily, seizing control of the victim’s mind. Minor Domination effects can be used to perform,
        but are not limited to, the following actions:
        A minor effect can create self-doubt in an opponent,
        forcing them to fight defensively. For the length of
        the Duration element, the target must choose the
        defensive casting or fight defensively actions.
        A minor effect can be used to temporarily charm a
        target, as the spell. Chaos mages gain a +5 insight
        bonus to attempts to charm chaotically aligned
        beings and suffer a -5 insight penalty to attempts to
        charm lawfully aligned beings.
        A minor effect can be used to enrage an opponent,
        forcing them to charge into close combat. Those who
        fail to save must move with all haste into melee range,
        and must attack with full attack actions once they are
        there. Each time they are attacked or struck, they are
        permitted a new Will save to shake off the effect.
        A minor effect can be used to cause fear, causing
        them to flee for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting,
        fear effect.
        A minor effect can overload an opponent’s senses,
        stunning them temporarily. A victim who fails to
        save is considered to be stunned for the Duration
        element.
        A minor effect can force creatures to believe your
        words to be truth, though not in face of overwhelming
        evidence to the contrary.
        Major Effect
        Casting DC: 15
        Save: Will Negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continuous Concentration: See below
        A major effect can have lasting implications on the
        target. A major Domination effect can be used to
        accomplish the following goals, among many others:
        A major Domination effect can alter a target’s
        alignment for the Duration element. The chaos
        mage can alter alignments only along the chaos–
        neutral–law axis (so he cannot make a target evil,
        for instance). He receives a +5 insight bonus to his
        casting check when attempting to alter another’s
        alignment to chaos, and a -5 insight penalty when
        attempting to alter an alignment to lawful.
        A major Domination effect can resculpt a single
        memory. For each round of the Duration element,
        the chaos mage can permanently alter one of the
        target’s memories as he sees fit. Note that this
        memory is changed only in a single context. You
        could, for example, change a memory so that the
        target remembers seeing you at a bazaar, rather than
        in the middle of his alchemical laboratory. You could
        not, however, change his memory so that he never
        remembered seeing you at all, because the memory
        of your face is tied in with other memories, such as
        his remembering that he does not much care for you. This Domination effect basically twists the target’s
        memory and then leaves it twisted – but every time
        a character is confronted with the true memory (such
        as someone reminding him), he is allowed a further
        Will saving throw.
        A major Domination effect can force unwanted
        emotions on the target, or targets. The chaos mage
        can create feelings of love, hate, distrust or absolute
        adoration, either between victims of the spell, or
        67
        CHAOS SORCERY
        Materialisation Effects and Damage
        Materialisation effects cannot be used to inflict
        Direct Damage. While a chaos mage can create
        a sword using Materialisation effects, and can
        also create an animated construct from pure
        chaos energy, he cannot drop energy anvils on
        his opponent’s head, nor may he materialise razor
        blades inside a hapless foe’s throat. When the
        chaos mage wishes to inflict damage directly, he
        must rely on Direct Damage effects.
        between victims and some other designated being,
        object or belief.
        A major Domination effect can seize control of a
        target’s mind for the length of the Duration element. The target is allowed a Will save against any activity
        you choose to undertake which is directly harmful
        to his person, or which is strongly against his
        belief. You gain a +5 insight bonus to your casting
        check when using this effect to control a chaotically
        aligned person, and suffer a -5 insight penalty when
        attempting to seize control of a lawfully aligned
        mind. This effect requires continuous concentration. Extraordinary Effect
        Casting DC: 20
        Save: Will negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continuous Concentration: See below
        Extraordinary Domination effects are powerful
        enough to change the fate of nations. Among other
        things, an extraordinary Domination effect can
        accomplish the following:
        It can fundamentally alter the nature of a being’s core
        beliefs. For the length of the Duration element, the
        victim’s alignment, both along the law vs chaos and
        good vs evil axis, can be altered to whatever the chaos
        mage desires.
        An extraordinary Domination effect can shut down a
        victim’s mind entirely. For the length of the Duration
        element, the victim’s Intelligence and Wisdom scores
        are reduced by up to the chaos mage’s caster level, to
        a minimum of 1.
        Materialisation
        Effects
        Materialisation effect elements allow the chaos mage
        to fashion solid items from pure chaos stuff. Objects
        created in this fashion appear wholly unnatural – or
        perhaps it is better to say that they appear utterly alien
        in their pure, otherworldly naturalness. In any case,
        chaos objects are unmistakable, their surfaces slick
        with currents of energy, currents which crackle and
        spark in a rainbow of bizarre shades. Materialised
        objects are roughly as strong and dense as bronze,
        though they would never be mistaken for that metal. Materialised objects can be made to appear anywhere
        within the range of the spell and do not have to appear
        in the same place should more than one object be
        created in the casting.
        Objects created with the Materialisation effect must
        have enough space to allow for their materialisation
        – a spiked ball cannot be made to materialise inside
        the skull of a target, for example, because there
        is simply not enough space for it. In addition, all
        Materialisation effects must be linked to a Duration
        element of at least One Round, lest they disappear the
        instant they are created.
        All materialised objects created with this effect
        element will radiate a magical aura, for the purposes
        of detect magic and similar spells, though they have
        no inherent magical properties.
        Images and sounds created by Materialisation effects
        are considered to be mind-affecting spell effects for
        the purposes of determining what may be affected by
        them.
        The difficulty of a Materialisation effect is directly
        linked to the size of the object, or objects, to be
        created. The increasing levels of effect that can be
        generated with this effect element are listed below.
        Negligible Effect
        Casting DC: 5
        Save: None
        Spell Resistance: No
        Continued Concentration: No
        A single item of up to an ounce of weight per caster
        level can be created from the primal matter of chaos. Alternately, the chaos mage can generate a quiet
        68
        CHAOS SORCERY
        noise, roughly equal to a soft cough, or a very dim
        light equivalent to a candle can be materialised.
        The sound created by a Negligible Materialisation
        effect is sufficient to awaken sleeping beings, so long
        as they are not under the effects of magical sleep.
        A Negligible effect is sufficient to create a simple
        chaotic construct with an equivalent Strength of 3. This construct can perform a single task, determined
        at the time of casting, but is largely immaterial and
        disperses immediately if attacked.
        The dim light created by a Negligible effect can be
        commanded to move, as a free action, anywhere
        within the area of effect of the spell, if the spell has
        an area of effect element. It arrives at its directed
        point effectively instantaneously.
        A Negligible Materialisation effect can
        produce a shroud of darkness sufficient
        to snuff a very dim light, equivalent to
        a candle, for the duration of the spell
        effect.
        Minor Effect
        Casting DC: 10
        Save: None
        Spell Resistance: No
        Continued Concentration: No
        A single item, weighing no more than
        one pound per caster level, can be
        created from chaos matter. This level
        of effect is also sufficient to generate
        a noise equivalent to armour clanking
        on stone, or strangely-inflected, mono-
        syllabic speech. Alternately, it can
        create a multi-coloured light equivalent
        to a lantern.
        A minor Materialisation effect
        is sufficient to create any of the
        following:
        A shield of chaos energy which
        offers increased protection from non-
        magical missiles and ranged attacks,
        and complete protection from single-
        target missile effect spells (such as
        magic missile, acid arrow and the
        like), unless the caster of that spell defeats the chaos
        mage in an opposed caster level check. Against non-
        magical ranged attacks, the subject gains a bonus to
        his Armour Class equal to +1 per two chaos mage
        class levels, to a maximum bonus of +5.
        The chaos mage may create a weapon, or weapons,
        so long as they do not weigh more than one pound
        per caster level. The weapon is considered to be of
        masterwork quality.
        A minor Materialisation effect can create a suit of
        armour from pure chaos energy. The suit provides
        a +1 armour bonus for every two chaos mage class
        levels, to a maximum bonus of +5. Armour created in
        this fashion is weightless and causes neither armour
        check penalties, or spell failure. In order to create a
        suit of armour in this fashion, the chaos mage must

        pounds, meaning he must be of at least 5th level. The
        bonuses from a suit of chaos armour replace, rather
        than stack with, those gained from normal armour,
        but do stack with those gained by a shield.
        A minor Materialisation effect can create a cloud of
        sparkling, greasy, opaque energy that obscures sight
        into and out of the affected area. The cloud fills an
        area equal to the spell’s area of effect – all creatures
        within the area of effect have total concealment from
        those outside the effect, and vice versa.
        Auditory effects created by a minor Materialisation
        effect can mimic speech, in any language in which the
        caster is fluent, but the sound is always recognisably
        not natural. The sound can be heard up to 20 feet
        from its point of origin, and can originate from
        anywhere within the spell’s area of effect, if an area
        of effect element has been chosen. The materialised
        speech lasts a maximum of 2 seconds per caster level,
        and repeats in an endless loop throughout the spell’s
        duration.
        A chaos construct with an equivalent Strength of 4
        can be created with a minor Materialisation effect,
        subject to the restrictions listed under Negligible
        effects.
        Weapons created with a minor Materialisation
        effect are considered to be magical weapons for the
        purposes of piercing damage reduction.
        Images created by a minor Materialisation effects
        are crude and unsubtle. They can spell out words,
        but any images created are crude as cave drawings. Multiple colours and images are possible, however,
        and can convey complex thoughts as envisioned by
        the caster. Created images can be made to move,
        or shift position, up to a maximum of 2 seconds per
        caster level.
        Moderate Effect
        Casting DC: 15
        Save: None
        Spell Resistance: No
        Continued Concentration: No
        At this level of effect, the chaos mage can create one
        or more items with a maximum combined weight
        of two pounds per level of the caster. Alternately,
        a moderate effect can produce loud and complex
        sounds, or normal human-sounding speech. If the
        caster wishes, he can instead summon up spectral
        lights in a variety of colours, with brightness
        equivalent to a daylight spell.
        Moderate effects are considerably more powerful and
        versatile than Negligible or Minor Materialisation
        effects. A chaos mage who successfully casts a
        moderate effect can achieve, but is not limited to, any
        of these effects:
        A moderate effect can duplicate an item accurately. It will replicate an item exactly, though it cannot
        duplicate magical properties. This sort of duplication
        is useful for creating items like keys, or puzzle
        pieces, as it duplicates them to the smallest detail, but
        the item will still appear unnatural to the naked eye.
        A moderate effect can create breathable air within
        the radius of effect. This sphere of air has positive
        pressure which helps prevent any poisonous gas from
        70
        CHAOS SORCERY
        entering the area of effect for the duration of the
        spell – those within the area of effect gain a +1 per
        two class level bonus to saves against poisonous gas
        effects, to a maximum bonus of +5.
        Weapons created with a moderate effect are
        considered to be magical weapons for the purposes
        of piercing damage reduction.
        A moderate effect can create a rudimentary chaos
        construct with an effective Strength of 7. This
        construct can obey a single simple order, chosen at
        the time of creation. It is physically unstable and
        disappears if struck.
        Images created with moderate effects appear real to
        the eyes, though a successful Will save allows the
        viewer to perceive the illusion for what it is. Images
        of this power have a tactile element as well, strong
        enough to create a sense of solidity. A successful
        Will save, however, allows those who come in contact
        with the image to not only resist its sensation, but the
        tactile element of any other images you create within
        the next 24 hours. As with minor effects, images
        created by a moderate Materialisation effect can be
        made to move and alter their shape, and can be as
        large as the spell’s total area of effect.
        Auditory illusions created by a moderate
        Materialisation effect can be of a maximum volume
        equal to a grown man shouting. Speech generated by
        a moderate effect sounds natural to the ear, and can
        be of any length up to and including the full duration
        of the spell.
        Major Effect
        Casting DC: 20
        Save: None
        Spell Resistance: No
        Continued Concentration: No
        A major Materialisation effect is sufficient to create
        objects with a maximum combined weight of five
        pounds per caster level. The items can also be imbued
        with sounds equivalent to a lion’s roar, or colours and
        light equivalent to the noon-day sun.
        Major Materialisation effects are truly powerful, as
        befits a spell effect so difficult to pull off. Major
        effects include, but are not limited to, the following:
        71
        CHAOS SORCERY
        A major Materialisation effect can create a wall of
        pure chaos energy, the size of one 10 feet cube per
        four caster levels. The cube may be shaped in any
        manner desired by the chaos mage, and has hardness
        5 and 10 hit points per 10 feet square per inch of
        thickness. This means that a 10 feet cube has 1,200
        hit points.
        A major effect can create a suit of armour that
        provides a +1 armour bonus per two caster levels, to a
        maximum bonus of +10. The suit is otherwise subject
        to the restrictions listed under minor Materialisation
        effects.
        An image summoned by a major manifestation is
        effectively real. At this level, the chaos mage can
        create any sound or image he can conceive, and it
        will appear exactly as the actual object or creature,
        with no traces of unnatural chaos energy. Those who
        know the image is false, or those who succeed at a
        Will save, see through the sensory illusion, and are
        only marginally affected by it. The chaos mage can
        create creatures of up to his caster level in hit dice,
        which can move freely as directed within the area of
        effect. Targets struck by the creature are allowed a
        Will save each time a blow connects – success means
        they suffer only a single hit point of damage. Major
        image manifestations can also mimic damaging
        effects, such as fireballs, with the targets suffering
        only a single point of damage if they succeed at a
        Will save when ‘struck’ by the effect.
        Weapons created with major Materialisation effect
        are considered to be magical weapons for the
        purposes of piercing damage reduction. Alternately,
        they can be created to mimic any one or two of the
        following special properties: anarchic, holy or unholy
        (as appropriate to the mage’s alignment), alchemical
        silver, adamantine or cold iron.
        Chaos Construct Effect
        Casting DC: 20 – 30
        Save: None
        Spell Resistance: No
        Continued Concentration: Yes
        A chaos mage can, if he chooses, create an animated
        creature of chaos, a being with rudimentary
        intelligence and the ability to follow its master’s
        orders. These entities are made of pure chaos matter,
        and appear as humanoids made of swirling motes of
        energy. When summoned, they coalesce anywhere
        within the spell’s range and are already aware of their
        first command.
        There are three classes of chaos construct, as shown
        on the Chaos Construct table.
        Chaos Construct (Su): Chaos constructs are
        only able to obey one simple order at a time. The
        summoning chaos mage can change this order as he
        wills, as a free action. The construct and the chaos
        mage who created it can communicate via mental
        command so long as the construct is with 100 + 10
        feet per caster level of the mage. Chaos constructs
        are immune to mind-affecting spells and spell like
        effects, poison and disease. Chaos constructs are
        likewise immune to critical hits, nonlethal damage,
        ability score damage, energy drain and death from
        massive damage. They have spell resistance equal
        to the caster level check result rolled during their
        creation, are considered outsiders, sharing their
        creator’s alignment.
        Movement Effects
        The ability to move nearly instantaneously from
        place to place is a powerful one and a huge boon to
        parties of adventurers. A chaos mage can, through
        sheer force of will, submerge himself, willing allies,
        and even unwilling targets, into the churning sea of
        chaos, effectively ignoring the concepts of space
        and time. A skilled chaos mage can step behind a
        rock and reappear at the bottom of the ocean, or hurl
        himself from a cliff top and come to rest on the soft
        earth of an extra-dimensional moon.
        The difficulty of a Movement effect is directly related
        to the distance to be travelled – the further the voyage,
        the more difficult the element is to incorporate into a
        casting.
        It is safer for a chaos mage to only move himself
        with his powers, for while others can easily slip
        into the chaos ether with him, their bodies, minds
        and souls are not likely to be prepared for what they
        will encounter there. Chaos mages can also use
        Movement effects to boost their allies’ speed, or to
        slow or even paralyse opponents.
        Movement effects with Duration elements can be
        used in either of the following two fashions:
        72
        CHAOS SORCERY
        The Dangers of Chaos Movement Effects
        Chaos mages think nothing of immersing
        themselves in the raw essence of chaos. Even
        the idea of surrendering to, and submersing
        themselves completely in the endless, churning
        river of chaos that lies between the dimensions
        holds no fear for them, for they understand its
        nature and indeed, are of its nature.
        The same cannot be said for other beings. Non-chaos mages who are targeted with chaos
        Movement effects must succeed at a Fortitude
        save against a DC of 15 or suffer nonlethal
        damage as follows:
        † Minor effect 1d8
        † Moderate effect 2d8
        † Major effect 3d8
        † Extreme 4d8
        † Universal 5d8
        Rolling a ‘1’ on the Fortitude results in the
        damage being lethal, not nonlethal.
        † The movement occurs slowly, over the course of
        the spell’s Duration element. When used in this
        fashion, the total movement should be divided as
        evenly as possible, with any remaining movement
        occurring in the last round of the spell’s duration. The speed of movement cannot be altered in any
        fashion, save by the use of another spell.
        † The Movement effect can work at up to full value
        in any round of the Duration element, as a move
        equivalent action. This allows for very rapid
        movement, up to and including flight (see below). When used in this fashion, the spell ends when the
        full potential value of its movement is reached. Spells of this sort include a protective element;
        should the recipient find himself in mid-air when
        the spell ends, he floats to the ground over the
        course of one round, as though by a feather fall
        spell.
        Minor Effect
        Casting DC: 10
        Save: Will Negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continued Concentration: No
        A minor Movement effect is sufficient to allow the
        caster or an amount of weight equal to 10 x his caster
        level to move a maximum distance of 20 feet + 5 feet
        per caster level.
        In addition, a minor Movement effect can be used to
        produce a number of related effects, including, but
        not limited to, those presented below:
        The spell effect can be used to open or shut a door,
        window, flap, pouch or any other object which can be
        opened or closed. The effect will not lock or unlock
        the target object, and is restricted to moving objects
        no heavier than 10 x the chaos mage’s caster level in
        pounds.
        The spell effect can create a field which presents
        creatures of a designated sex, racial type or other
        visible identifying characteristic from touching the
        target of the spell or moving with the area of effect of
        the spell. This prevents unarmed attacks, but will not
        prevent the use of ranged attacks or attacks with reach
        by the prohibited creature. Multiple stacked effects
        of this sort must be overcome individually, should a
        creature belong to more than one banned group.
        The chaos mage can ‘throw’ his voice by shunting it
        through the quicksilver chaos ether. His words are
        transmitted instantly from his mouth to the targeted
        creature or area of effect, and can only be heard by
        those within that area.
        A minor Movement effect can increase or decrease
        a target’s base speed by 5 feet + 1 feet per caster
        level, to a maximum of +/– 15 feet. Speed cannot be
        reduced below 5 feet in this fashion.
        A minor Movement effect can grant a +1 per caster
        level bonus (to a maximum of +10), to saves against
        all spells and spell-like effects which impede
        movement, and render the recipient immune to the
        effects of terrain and conditions which normally
        hinder movement. A person so enhanced can
        move at full normal speed regardless of terrain
        conditions, though they gain no special immunity to
        environmental damage.
        A minor Movement effect can grant a +1 per caster
        level bonus, to a maximum of +10, to all saves against
        environmental hazards and fatigue.
        73
        CHAOS SORCERY
        Dropping Enemies from Great Heights
        (or ‘Devious Player Problems’)
        Clever and especially murderous players might
        seize upon the Movement effect as a convenient
        way to eliminate their opposition. After all, it
        would seem a relatively simple matter to just
        pop a target out of existence and then bring them
        back 500 feet above the tree line. This is, in truth,
        a very useful tactic, which seems like it could
        quickly unbalance play. This powerful ability is,
        however, balanced by the following:
        † The target is allowed a Will save to completely
        negate the effect.
        † The casting check DCs of Movement effects
        are slightly higher than those of other effects. Combined with the need to add area effects to
        offensive uses of this power, lest the caster be
        forced to risk delivering the effect by touch,
        this can lead to high casting check failure
        rates.
        † By the time the chaos mage can reliably use
        this power, many of his opponents should, and
        will, have access to flight or similar abilities.
        Should you feel the potential benefits of offensive
        use of this power are still too great, introduce the
        following rule:
        Vertical movement is considered five times more
        distant than horizontal movement, unless the
        target is being moved to an area of solid footing. This makes teleporting extremely difficult if the
        target is to be popped fifty feet up into empty
        air, but no more difficult if he is to be moved to
        a platform fifty feet up. This limitation does not
        apply to willing subjects.
        Moderate Effect
        Casting DC: 15
        Saves: Will Negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Concentration: No
        A moderate Movement effect is sufficient to allow
        travel to a distance of 100 feet + 10 feet per caster
        level.
        Alternately, a moderate Movement effect can be used
        to create related effects, including, but not limited to,
        those listed below:
        The targets of the spell are anchored to the current
        plane of existence and are unable to leave unless they
        defeat the chaos mage in an opposed caster level
        check, using either their spellcasting level or Will
        save (their choice). Creatures with natural extra-
        dimensional movement powers use their hit dice as
        their caster level for the purposes of the check, unless
        their movement powers have a listed effective caster
        level.
        The target object of this effect changes from open to
        closed. Suitable targets include pouches, windows,
        doors or any other object which can be open or
        closed. This will, if the caster wishes, automatically
        lock or unlock any one bar, lock, restraint, tie or other
        sealing device. Each additional sealing device to be
        locked or unlocked increases the DC of the effect by
        1. Alternately, the caster can open or close any two
        objects, but will not be able to lock or unlock them
        with this spell effect.
        All creatures are prevented from entering the nearby
        area (the size of the area is determined by the area
        effect attached to the spell), or from touching the
        targeted object or being. A Will save overcomes
        the effect and renders the one who saved immune
        to further moderate Movement effects of this sort
        for one day. Alternately, the effect can be reversed,
        preventing creatures from leaving the area of effect.
        For the duration of the spell, all targeted creatures
        can communicate perfectly with one another, so
        long as they remain with 100 feet per caster level
        of the chaos mage. Unaffected beings cannot hear
        the recipients of the spell at all, as their voices are
        directly transmitted from recipient to recipient. This
        is not a mind-affecting effect, nor is it telepathic in
        nature.
        The target, or targets, of the Movement effect are able
        to climb up walls or across ceilings at their normal
        movement rate for the duration of the spell. If an
        area effect is added to the spell and it is targeted on
        an area, then any being can move across any surface
        of that area as though it were level ground.
        A moderate effect can be used to grant a target an
        extra attack when making a full attack action. When
        augmented in this fashion, the recipient’s base speed
        74
        CHAOS SORCERY
        is increased by 1 feet per caster level. Conversely, it
        can be used to restrict a target, or targets, to a single
        standard or move action each turn. Those affected
        by this effect suffer a -1 feet per caster level penalty
        to their movement, to a minimum speed of 5 feet per
        round.
        Major Effect
        Casting DC: 20
        Save: Will Negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continued Concentration: No
        A major Movement effect is sufficient to allow
        affected beings to move 500 feet + 50 feet per caster
        level.
        Alternately, a major Movement effect can be used to
        do the following:
        The words of the recipient, or recipients, of the spell
        are transferred to one another over a distance of up to
        10 miles + 1 mile per caster level. Unaffected beings
        cannot hear the recipients of the spell at all, as their
        voices are directly transmitted from recipient to
        recipient. This is not a mind-affecting effect,
        nor is it telepathic in nature.
        A major Movement effect
        can be used to animate
        non-living objects, as by
        an animate object spell. The total of the chaos
        mage’s caster check is the
        number of small objects
        which can be animated by
        the use of this effect. For
        the purposes of determining
        how many larger objects
        can be moved, use the
        equivalencies listed in the
        animate object spell.
        A major effect can open or
        close a single object as long
        as its weight is no greater
        than 100 pounds + 50 pounds
        per level of the caster. This
        effect can also lock or unlock
        a single restraining device,
        such as a bar, lock, or tie. Alternately, a major effect can be used to open or
        close, and lock and unlock, any number of objects
        no larger or heavier than a standard metal door. By
        increasing the DC by 1, the spell can automatically
        break a single enchanted lock, such as those of held
        or arcane locked doors.
        Extreme Effect
        Casting DC: 25
        Save: Will Negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continued Concentration: No
        An extreme Movement effect is powerful enough
        to move recipients 1 mile + 1 mile per caster
        level. Alternately, it can be used to create other
        effects, including, but not limited to, the following
        examples:
        An extreme Movement effect can transmit spoken
        language, instantaneously, to anywhere on the plane. Unaffected beings cannot hear the recipients of the
        spell at all, as their voices are directly transmitted
        from recipient to recipient. This is not a mind-
        affecting effect, nor is it telepathic in nature.
        A targeted creature which fails a Will save
        is instantaneously returned to its plane of
        origin.
        A targeted area of ground
        or wall can be made to
        repel all beings who come
        within range. Beings
        who fail to save begin to
        levitate and are lifted up or
        pushed away at a rate of
        1 feet per caster level per
        round, for the duration
        of the spell, or until
        they leave the area
        of effect.
        75
        CHAOS SORCERY
        The Killing Transformation
        Transformation effects, like polymorph spells,
        are potential game breakers if not monitored
        carefully. The following rules are presented here
        to highlight their importance.
        Transformations cannot purposefully transform
        portions of an inanimate object. Only complete
        objects can be transformed with this effect. A
        door could be transformed independently of the
        wall it is built into, as the door is a complete
        object in and of itself. Conversely, a single hinge
        or nail in said door could not be transformed, as
        it is a component of the door. To allow otherwise
        risks situations like the following: A chaos mage
        chooses to transform two walls of a shack into air,
        likely causing the other two walls and the roof
        to instantly collapse. At the end of the effect’s
        duration, when the two walls return to their
        original form, the other walls and the roof would
        remain destroyed.
        Additionally, no creature may be killed outright
        via a Transformation effect. If a creature is
        transformed into inanimate matter, raw energy,
        a non-living state or any other potentially lethal
        form, the creature reforms, unharmed, in its
        original location (unless removed by Movement
        effects or external forces) at the end of the effect’s
        duration.
        Living creatures can only be subject to one
        Transformation effect at any one time. The
        strongest (highest Transformation effect DC)
        will dispel all others when placed on a creature
        and weaker Transformation effects will be
        automatically resisted.
        Universal Effect
        Casting DC: 30
        Save: Will Negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continued Concentration: No
        A universal effect is the most powerful of all
        Movement effects, sufficient to allow the chaos
        mage, or those he designates as targets, to pierce the
        veil between worlds and travel to other dimensions. A single casting allows the targeted beings, to move
        to a dimension which is, cosmologically speaking,
        next to the one they are on. Chaos mages gain a +5
        insight bonus when dimension shifting to chaotically-
        aligned planes, and suffer a -5 insight penalty when
        moving to lawfully-aligned planes.
        Transformation
        Effect
        At their simplest, Transformation effects are little
        tricks useful for cleanliness, or mending cloth
        or erasing spilled drops of ink and the like. At
        their most complex, Transformation effects can
        fundamentally alter the nature of reality, changing
        lead to gold and transforming man to beast with equal
        facility. It is with good reason, then, that men fear the
        transformative power of chaos.
        Regardless of the strength of the effect, the total
        amount of material which may be transformed
        (physically or mentally) is equal to 20 pounds per
        level of the caster.
        Many of the effects listed below allow the caster
        to grant or inflict a variety of bonuses or penalties
        to a subject. In every case, the exact bonuses and
        penalties may be specified by the caster, though the
        maximum bonus is equal to +1 or -1 per two caster
        levels.
        All Transformation effects must be coupled with
        a Duration element. Those that do not include a
        Duration element can still transform their target,
        but the target returns to its original shape almost
        instantaneously, without adverse or positive effect.
        Negligible Effect
        Casting DC: 5
        Save: Will negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continued Concentration: No
        Negligible Transformation effects allow for nothing
        more than surface changes, or the most minor of
        benefits. Examples of these benefits include, but are
        not limited to:
        A Negligible effect can clean or repair minor damage
        to an object. This includes repairing tears in fabric,
        fixing seams, closing small holes in metal, fixing
        chipped bits of wood or erasing stains and spots. A
        single application of a Negligible effect will repair
        all incidental damage on an object no larger than a
        traveller’s cloak. This mends up to 1 hit point per two
        caster levels of damage to the object.
        76
        CHAOS SORCERY
        A Negligible effect can grant an enhancement bonus
        to a single saving throw for the duration of the effect. The specific saving throw is selected at the time of
        casting and the bonus is granted for the length of the
        Duration element attached, or until the recipient fails
        an enhanced save.
        A Negligible Transformation effect can alter the
        appearance of a subject or object, similar to the
        disguise self spell. The effect grants a bonus to all
        Disguise checks equal to +1 per two caster levels.
        A Negligible Transformation effect can erase or
        create one written sentence per caster level, simply
        by altering the patterns on the written surface.
        A Negligible Transformation effect can render any
        object or creature immune to the effects of 0 levels
        spells of all sorts, unless the caster of the 0 level spell
        defeats the chaos mage in an opposed caster level
        check.
        Minor Effect
        Casting DC: 10
        Save: Will Negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continued Concentration: No
        Minor Transformation effects are both powerful and
        dangerous. At this level of effect, a chaos mage may,
        among other things:
        Grant an enhancement bonus or penalty to all saves,
        to Armour Class, or to a single ability score. The
        maximum granted bonus is equal to +1 per two chaos
        mage caster levels.
        Grant resistance to a specific type of energy (acid,
        cold, electric, fire or sonic) equal to +1 per caster
        level.
        A minor effect can be used to deafen or blind a target,
        or targets, for the duration of the effect. Alternately,
        the effect can be used to restore vision and hearing
        – if the loss of senses was caused by a magical effect,
        then that effect is permanently dispelled, but if the
        blindness or deafness was natural, then the restoration
        lasts only so long as the Duration element.
        The targets, of a minor effect can be rendered immune
        to all spells of a given school for the duration of the
        effect, unless the caster of the spell defeats the chaos
        mage in an opposed caster level check. Alternately,
        the target, or targets, can be rendered immune to all
        1st level spells of all schools, unless the caster defeats
        the chaos mage in an opposed caster level check.
        A minor effect can create a hole in a solid, non-living
        object of up to 1 foot in diameter and 1 foot in depth
        per class level. The targeted object receives a saving
        throw as normal.
        A minor Transformation effect can render targets
        effectively invisible. The recipients cannot be seen
        by normal sight, though the effect ends immediately
        if the beneficiary attacks any target, casts a spell or
        does anything which draws attention to itself.
        The target of the spell effect gains low-light vision or
        darkvision to a range of 10 feet per caster level. This
        ability does not allow the recipient to see through
        magical darkness.
        The critical threat range of targeted weapons is
        increased by 2 steps (so a rapier increases its threat
        range from 18-20 to 16-20), as it’s chaotic chances of
        dealing grievous damage are temporarily enhanced.
        A minor effect can transform the state of non-living
        matter, albeit to a minor degree. It can transform
        matter into other, similar, forms of matter, which
        must be as supple or solid as the original form. So, for example, it can transform paper to cloth, or
        change oak to cedar, but could not transform water
        into rock. Non-living matter can only be transformed
        into a material which has the same hardness, or a
        hardness one point greater or less, than the original
        material.
        All non-magical fires within the target effect are
        immediately extinguished. Alternately, the effect can
        be used to produce flame, as the spell at the chaos
        mage’s caster level.
        Moderate Effect
        Casting DC: 15
        Saves: Will negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continued Concentration: No
        Moderate Transformation effects are capable of
        rendering massive changes in the target, warping

        their form and their flesh as easily as a potter shapes
        clay. Examples of moderate Transformation effects
        include:
        Cause solid objects to become ethereal for the length
        of the Duration element. Living beings rendered
        ethereal by means of this effect cannot affect the
        physical world until the effect ends, but can interact
        with ethereal creatures as normal.
        Grant the targeted being energy resistance to two
        forms of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire or sonic),
        equal to 2 per three caster levels for the duration of
        the effect. Alternately, it grants 3 points of energy
        resistance per 2 class levels to any single form of
        energy.
        A moderate Transformation effect can suppress a
        single magical quality (supernatural or spell-like)
        in an object or being for the duration of the effect,
        unless the target succeeds with its Will save. The
        magical quality is not permanently erased, simply
        suppressed, and take effect again immediately upon
        the Transformation effect’s conclusion.
        The target creature gains damage reduction equal to
        the caster’s class level + 5, which is only susceptible
        to lawful or magical attacks.
        The target creature, or creatures, gains the ability
        to see in darkness as though with low light vision
        or darkvision, to a range of 10 feet per caster level. The recipient also gains the ability to see through all
        magical forms of darkness, or through other magical
        effects which restrict vision. Alternately, the target
        creatures can be given the ability to see invisible and
        ethereal creatures.
        A moderate effect can double the critical threat range
        of a target weapon, or weapons. This doubling does
        not apply to any increases already gained due to a
        minor Transformation effect.
        A moderate effect can increase or decrease the size
        of a target object or creature by 10% per level of the
        78
        CHAOS SORCERY
        caster, to a maximum of 50%. Note that the object or
        target can only expand to the limits of its environment,
        and only shrink until it meets the resistance of objects
        it contains. Therefore, this effect could not be used
        to crush a warrior in his own armour by reducing
        its size or increasing his. See the Transformation
        Size Modifiers table for the effects of increasing or
        decreasing the size of a creature or object.
        A moderate effect can alter a subject’s form, in a
        similar manner to an alter self spell.
        A moderate effect can convert the state of non-living
        matter, as a minor effect can, but on a greater
        level. At this level, the chaos
        mage is not restricted to
        transforming objects
        to similar materials
        and can, should he so
        choose, transform stone
        to sand, or water to
        wood.

        A total Transformation
        effect is startling in its
        comprehensiveness and
        sheer power. Among other
        uses, it can cause:
        Target creatures or objects in the area to be
        rendered completely immune to all spells of 5th
        level or less for the length of the Duration element,
        unless the caster of the spell defeats the chaos mage
        in an opposed caster check. Alternately, the target
        becomes immune to all spells, regardless of level, of
        a particular school, unless the caster wins an opposed
        caster check.
        Alterations to a target, causing them to become wholly
        insubstantial. The recipient, as well as all carried
        equipment, are able to pass through even the smallest
        cracks or holes. While in this state, affected creatures
        can move at their normal movement rate, but are
        unable to fly or swim. They gain damage reduction
        20/lawful and are unable to physically attack or cast
        spells which require material components.
        Transformations of living beings into solid, non-
        living materials. They gain hardness equal to 5, or
        the established hardness of the material if it is higher,
        but are rendered unable to move or act.
        A total Transformation effect can change raw
        materials into finished, crafted products. For
        example, a stick of wood could be transformed into a
        finely crafted staff. When combined with a second
        Transformation effect to
        convert materials into
        another form, the same
        stick of wood could become
        a longsword or
        battleaxe.
        Non-living to be
        converted matter into
        another, dissimilar
        type – water into
        steel, or wood into
        air, for example. Alternately, non-
        living matter can
        simply be transformed
        into harmless, light based
        energy for the duration of
        the effect.
        A subject to gain the equivalent
        of improved invisibility for the length
        of the Duration element.
        A total Transformation can grant an object an entirely
        new form, as though by the spells polymorph,
        polymorph any object or baleful polymorph.

        CHAOS SORCERY
        The ultimate expression of the transformative power
        of chaos. At this level of effect, items are transformed
        into pure chaos energy and can be refashioned as the
        chaos mage wills. Weight can be increased by 10%
        per caster level, uniquely beneficial features can
        be added and the composition of the object can be
        changed in utterly unnatural ways.
        At the moment of transformation, chaotic energies
        flare up in a 20 foot radius around each target,
        causing 1d8 points of damage for every 20 pounds
        transformed, to a maximum of 10d8 damage, to
        everyone but the target. No creature with hit dice
        greater than the chaos mage’s class level may be
        affected, nor may inanimate objects which weigh
        more than 100 pounds per caster level.
        Creatures altered by chaotic reconstruction can
        move between size categories, suffering bonuses or
        penalties to their Armour Class and base attack bonus
        modifiers as appropriate.
        A chaos mage can also use a chaotic reconstruction
        Transformation effect to disrupt and suppress all
        existing magical effects, subject to the chaos mage
        overcoming all the original casters with a single
        opposed caster check. All spells or spell-like effects
        successfully overcome in this fashion are suppressed
        for the length of the Duration element.
        Finally, a chaotic reconstruction Transformation
        effect can also be used to twist reality like taffy. A
        successful casting check allows the chaos mage to
        alter the fundamental structure of reality, just like
        a wish spell. Material components are not needed
        to create such an effect, but the chaos mage’s
        transformations are still limited to impermanent
        effects.
        Combining Multiple
        Effects
        Part of the chaos mage’s strength lies in his ability
        to combine multiple effects within a single casting. This ability to modify spells on the fly gives the chaos
        mage a versatility that traditional arcane casters
        simply cannot match. To determine the casting DC
        of a spell with more than one effect, first determine
        which effect begins with the lowest casting DC. Then, add one half of that lower DC (rounding up)
        to the casting DC of the other effect, which gives
        you the total effect element DC. In cases where two
        separate effects have the same casting DC, simply
        select one of them for the reduced cost. The effect
        with the reduced cost is referred to as the subsidiary
        effect.
        As a chaos mage grows in power, he gains the ability
        to blend third, fourth and fifth elements into his
        spells. When combining three or more elements,
        calculate the final casting DC just as you would
        with only two elements – namely, halve the values
        of all the subsidiary casting DCs, save the highest,
        and then add that amount to the highest effect’s DC
        to determine the total casting DC. As before, these
        additional effects are considered to be subsidiary
        effects.
        So, for example, a chaos mage wishes to combine
        three elements, with casting DCs of 5, 10 and 15
        together. To calculate the total casting DC, he
        divides the two lowest (5 and 10) in half, to 3 and 5
        respectively, then adds them to the highest DC, for a
        final casting DC of 3 + 5 +15 = 23.
        When multiple effects exist within a single spell, by
        default they all share the same area of effect, range,
        duration and saving throw elements, as well as sharing
        the ability to defeat spell resistance. An element that
        is always instantaneous (like the Raw Damage effect)
        may be included with effects of a differing duration,
        however, without penalty. This includes persistent
        and Degrading Damage effects, which last as long
        as is required to deliver their full damage, even if the
        rest of the spell effects end before that time.
        Stacking Multiple Effects
        It is also possible to stack multiple effects of the
        same type. It is not permitted, however, for multiple
        elements of the same type to be the only effects within
        the spell. If you are able to cast a spell containing
        three elements, for example, all three cannot be
        damage effect elements. Further, you cannot put
        two elements of the exact same type in the same
        spell. So you can have a spell with a Domination
        effect and two Transformation effects, but they must
        be Transformation effects of a different degree – one
        minor and one major, for example.

        CHAOS SORCERY
        Step Two: Choose an
        Area Element
        All chaos magic spells default to a single target. A
        chaos mage, however, can extend his power across a
        wider area, provided he is willing to risk overreaching
        his ability to control the energy he summons. The
        complete definitions of the areas of effect listed
        below can be found in Core Rulebook I. A chaos
        mage can select any area of effect element, but must
        modify the casting DC of the spell, as noted below. Each spell effect can, of course be modified by only
        one of the following areas of effect:
        Single Target (DC +0)
        The default setting for chaos weaves, the target may
        be either the chaos mage himself or another person.
        Two Targets (DC +3)
        A chaos mage can, if he so chooses, affect two
        different targets with a single spell. A spell with
        this area element must be coupled with a range of
        Touch, Close, Medium, Long or Extreme – the spell
        affects only those targets which are within its range,
        meaning spells which require the presence of both
        targets automatically fail to take effect if both targets
        are not within reach. This spell failure is independent
        of the casting check required to successfully weave
        the spell, meaning a spell which fizzles out due to
        one target being out of range does not cause backlash. The two targets of the spell must be chosen at the
        moment of casting.
        For example, a minor Movement effect designed
        to instantaneously swap two beings’ positions will
        only work if both targets are within the spell’s
        range. Should only one of the intended targets fall
        within the spell’s range, then neither target is moved. Conversely, a Direct Damage spell which can affect
        two targets does not require the presence of both
        targets – it affects each target independently.
        Burst (DC +5)
        The minimum burst radius is 5 feet, and the maximum
        is equal to the caster level x 5 feet. The burst radius is
        chosen at the time of casting.
        Cone (DC +5)
        The minimum length of the cone is 10 feet, and
        the maximum is equal to caster level x 5 feet. The
        exact dimensions must be chosen at the moment of
        casting.
        Spread (DC +10)
        The minimum spread is 5 feet, and the maximum
        is equal to the caster’s level x 5 feet. The exact
        dimensions of the spread must be chosen at the
        moment of casting.
        Modifiers to Area of Effect Elements
        Once an area of effect element has been chosen, it
        can be enhanced by the following modifiers. Each
        modifier comes with its own casting DC, which must
        be added to the total casting check DC of the spell.
        Enemies Only (DC +5)
        The spell affects hostile targets only. Note that
        this does not require the chaos mage know who his
        enemies are – the magic knows the intent of those
        within the area of effect.
        Allies Only (DC +5)
        The spell affects friendly targets only. As above, the
        mage is not required to know who his enemies are. The magic does, and that is enough.
        Chosen (DC +1 per subject)
        The caster specifies which creature in the area of
        effect will not be targeted. Note that subjects so
        specified do not have to be visible to the caster when
        they are chosen, though he must be aware of them. The casting DC modifier is +1 per subject not to be
        targeted within the area of effect.
        Objects Only (DC +0)
        Should the caster wish, he can choose to only affect
        inanimate objects, including those worn or held,
        without modifying the spell check DC.
        Step Three: Choose A
        Range Element
        By default, chaos magic spells are assumed to have
        a range of personal, meaning they affect only the
        caster. A chaos mage can, of course, project his spell
        energy across greater distances, as outlined below.
        Games Masters are encouraged not to allow precise
        measuring of distances. Chaos mages are famed
        for their rashness, and few will bother to pace out
        the distance to a target when they can simply fire
        away and hope for the best. A chaos mage should,
        however, be allowed a Spellcraft check against a DC
        of 15 – if he succeeds, he knows the approximate
        range of the target.
        81
        CHAOS SORCERY
        As before, the chaos mage is free to modify the
        ranges of the spell as he chooses, but must always
        add the casting DC to the final casting check.
        Touch or Self (DC +0)
        The spell discharges to any object touched by the
        caster, or into the caster himself. If attempting to
        touch an unwilling target, the chaos mage must
        succeed at a touch attack. The charge of a touch
        spell can be held by the chaos mage for a number
        of rounds equal to one-half his level, rounded
        down, to a minimum of 1 round. If the spell has not
        been discharged by that point, the chaotic energies
        evaporate harmlessly into static reality.
        Close (DC +1)
        The maximum range of the spell is 25 feet + 5 feet per
        two caster levels.
        Medium (DC +5)
        The maximum range of the spell is 100 feet + 10 feet
        per caster level.
        Long (DC +10)
        The maximum range of the spell is 400 feet + 40 feet
        per caster level.
        Extreme (DC +15)
        The maximum range of the spell is 1 mile + 1 mile
        per caster level. Without the aid of divination magic,
        which chaos magic cannot empower, or without
        intimate knowledge of the target (such as if the
        target were an acquaintance or the target an area the
        caster knew well), the caster cannot effectively target
        beyond his line of sight.
        Step Four: Choose a
        Duration Element
        Without selecting one of the Duration elements listed
        below, any spell the chaos mage casts is considered to
        be of Instantaneous duration. Chaos magic is difficult
        to control, and twists like a snake in the chaos mage’s
        mind, but a skilled practitioner can force chaos to
        hold itself to the shape he dictates.
        Note that Raw Damage effect elements can only ever
        be instantaneous in duration, though both Degrading
        and Persistent Damage effects continue to affect
        their targets for multiple rounds. Also remember
        that damage inflicted by chaos damage effects is
        permanent until healed, and does not fade simply
        because the spell does. All other chaos magic spells
        can be forced to hold any of the durations presented
        below, but the casting DC must of course be added to
        the final spellcasting check.
        Instantaneous (DC +0)
        The effect is applied immediately and lasts but a
        split-second before evaporating.
        One Round (DC +2)
        The spell’s effects apply for a single round.
        By Round (DC +5)
        The spell’s duration is increased to one round per
        caster level.
        By Minute (DC +10)
        The spell has a duration of one minute per caster
        level.
        By Hour (DC +15)
        The spell has a duration of one hour per two caster
        levels.
        Once a Duration element has been chosen, it can be
        further modified by the following option:
        Secondary Duration (DC variable)
        A secondary Duration element can be applied to any
        one subsidiary effect element which can be given
        a duration. It enables the chaos mage to delay the
        subsidiary effects of his spells until after the primary
        effect has finished – without this modification, all of
        a spell’s effects occur at the same time. A secondary
        Duration element costs half the increase to casting DC
        (rounded up), so that a secondary By Round duration
        would add 3 to the casting DC, rather than 5.
        For example: A 10th level chaos mage creates a spell
        with two effects, using a major Transformation as
        the primary effect and a minor Domination effect as
        the subsidiary. The Transformation effect is given a
        duration of By Round, and the Domination effect is
        modified by a secondary duration of By Round. This
        means that the Transformation effect lasts 10 rounds
        and then, in the round immediately following its final
        round, the Domination effect begins and will last for
        10 rounds.
        82
        CHAOS SORCERY
        Enforcing the Idea of Freeform Magic
        Freedom. It is what chaos magic is all about. While the vast majority of chaos magic spells
        will include both verbal and somatic components,
        it seems counter-intuitive to force these upon
        every conceivable spell weave. For those who
        wish to allow chaos mages to discard one of the
        final mechanics which ties their arcane spells to
        traditional ‘spell slot’ casting, we suggest you
        incorporate the following.
        Forgo Component (DC + 5)
        This effect modifier allows the chaos mage to
        forgo the need for either the verbal or somatic
        components of his spell. Under no circumstances
        can the need for both verbal and somatic
        components be eliminated.
        Combining Area and Duration
        Elements
        When a chaos spell is woven, the caster can freely
        specify one of two additional effects, but only so long
        as he has added both area and duration elements to
        the spell effect.
        † The spell’s effect applies to a specific area for its
        duration, and the spell applies only to creatures
        while they remain within the area of effect. Creatures who move out of the area are no longer
        affected by the spell, but may re-enter the area of
        effect should they so choose.
        † The spell’s effect will apply to a specific subject
        for its duration, meaning the spell’s effects apply
        only to those beings who were within the area of
        effect at the time of casting. Other beings may
        enter the area of effect, but are not subject to the
        spell’s effects, while those who started within the
        area of effect and later leave are still subject to the
        spell’s effects.
        Step Five: Choose A
        Saving Throw Element
        All chaos magic spells have a base saving throw DC
        equal to 10 + the caster’s Wisdom bonus + half the
        caster’s level, rounded down. This means that most
        chaos magic spells will be about as hard to resist as
        those cast by more traditional methods. Chaos magic
        is quick and abundant, but lacks the deadly punch of
        prepared arcana.
        Should he so choose, however, a chaos mage can
        attempt to overcharge his spells with raw chaos
        particles, giving it an increased ability to penetrate
        arcane defences, at the cost of making it much more
        difficult to control. At the time of casting, before
        saving throws are attempted, the chaos mage can alter
        the save DC of the spell, as outlined below:
        Note that the penalties to saving throws listed below
        stack with the penalty lawful creatures already face
        against chaos magic effects.
        It is possible for a spell to be woven which provides
        the victim with a bonus to his saving throws. While
        this considerably weakens the offensive power of the
        spell, it also reduces its cost, which can be important
        at low levels. Bonuses to saving throws can normally
        only be added to Direct Damage effects, but with the
        Games Master’s permission, they may be added to
        other types of spell weaves which are directed at the
        chaos mage’s enemies.
        +2 bonus to saves
        The casting DC is modified by -3
        +1 bonus to saves
        The casting DC is modified by -1
        +/-0 to saves
        Default. No modification to saves
        -1 penalty to saves
        The casting DC is modified by +2
        -2 penalty to saves
        The casting DC is modified by +5
        -3 penalty to saves
        The casting DC is modified by +8
        -4 penalty to saves
        The casting DC is modified by +10
        -5 penalty to saves
        The casting DC is modified by +12
        83
        CHAOS SORCERY
        Overcoming Spell Resistance
        Though their spells lack the ability to easily punch
        through a target’s normal defences, chaos mages have
        a potential advantage against those foes who possess
        spell resistance. Creatures with the innate ability to
        shake off spell energy are without a doubt the bane
        of spellcasters, as they can render even the mightiest
        spell to little more than sparks. Chaos mages,
        however, with their ability to warp reality to their
        desire, can direct their spell energies to bypass spell
        resistance altogether, though the cost is great.
        To ignore a target’s spell resistance and avoid the
        necessity of making the required caster level check,
        declare to the Games Master your intention and
        figure the spell’s DC as per normal. Roll as per
        normal to see if he spell works, but the Games Master
        will deduct the total spell resistance of the target from
        your casting check. Bypassing spell resistance is a
        great risk, but can be a chaos mage’s greatest boon
        when dealing with powerful magical creatures.
        Step Six: Casting the
        Spell (Required)
        After all the elements of the spell have been chosen
        and the modified casting DC of the spell determined,
        it is time to cast the spell.
        To see if he successfully twines the threads of chaos,
        the chaos mage simply needs his casting check to
        equal or exceed the casting DC of the spell (a casting
        check being 1d20 + caster level + Wisdom modifier).
        Success results in the spell working as the chaos
        mage desires. Such a thing is to be commended,
        as the way of chaos is not an easy path to follow. Failure, however, can have dreadful consequences. The chaos mage suffers lethal, rather than nonlethal,
        damage when casting the spell and is also considered
        stunned until the beginning of his next turn.
        In addition, should a chaos mage roll a 1 on his
        casting check, he suffers a backlash of chaos energy
        – see the Paths of Chaos chapter for complete details
        of what this means for the character.
        Triggers
        Chaos magic can be exceptionally difficult to cast,
        with truly prohibitive casting DCs for the most
        powerful spells. This suits the nature of chaos well,
        as it should be difficult to tame the pure essence of
        unpredictability. To compensate for this, chaos mages
        quickly master a few tricks which, while they limit
        the spell’s overall utility, serve to ease the difficulty
        when casting the more difficult enchantments.
        These tricks are generally known as triggers,
        referring to the fact they limit spells to taking effect
        only when specific, beset conditions are met. When
        that condition is met, the spell is triggered.
        Triggers can be set to react either to the attempt to
        do something, in which case they go off before the
        attempted action, or as a response to an action taken,
        in which case they go off immediately after the
        successful completion of the action.
        Like chaos magic effects, triggers come in different
        categories, as described below. Regardless of the
        strictness of the conditions, no trigger can reduce
        the casting DC of a spell to less than half of its base
        effect DC (rounding up). So, for example, a chaotic
        84
        CHAOS SORCERY
        reconstruction effect (base DC 30) could not be
        reduced below a casting DC of 15.
        No more than one trigger can ever be applied to a
        particular spell, regardless of how many spell effects
        are included.
        Common Triggers (DC -5)
        Common triggers can be easily met and are most
        often used to set chaos magic ‘traps’. While a trigger
        might not be tripped, thereby rendering the spell
        useless, a little practice will allow the chaos mage to
        craft spells and triggers that are almost assured to be
        unleashed by his enemies or allies, as the case may
        be. Examples of common triggers include, but are
        not limited to, the following:
        The spell is actually transferred through a physical
        attack and will only affect those who are physically
        struck. Note that this does not mean the chaos mage
        must do the hitting – the spell could be cast upon an
        allied fighter, for example, who then transfers the
        effect to targets he strikes. Note that this trigger
        supersedes the Touch area element; a spell with this
        trigger is transmitted with a standard attack, not a
        touch attack.
        The spell only affects those who perform a specific
        action within its area of effect, such as making a
        melee attack, casting a spell, drawing a weapon or
        running. Note that the trigger must be a volitional
        act that requires real effort on the part of the affected
        party – a trigger that affects anyone who breathes, for
        example, is not valid.
        The spell can be set to detonate immediately after the
        triggering event occurs, or togo off after a specific
        amount of time has passed, but this time can be no
        less than one minute. The time between casting and
        triggering does not count against the spell’s duration
        element.
        The trigger goes off when a specified, common
        environmental condition occurs, such as snow in the
        mountains.
        Uncommon Triggers (DC -10)
        Uncommon triggers are more difficult to set off and
        my never be tripped at all. These require a specific
        action of a specific type to be fulfilled, as illustrated
        by the sample triggers below.
        A trigger which is only activated when a fireball is
        cast is an uncommon trigger.
        Attacking the chaos mage (or another, specified
        target) will fulfill the trigger and cast the spell.
        Using a specific skill is an appropriate condition for
        an uncommon trigger.
        The trigger goes off when a specified, uncommon
        environmental condition occurs, such as snow in the
        desert.
        Rare Triggers (DC -15)
        Triggers of this sort require the fulfilment of
        conditions which will, likely as not, never occur in the
        course of normal adventure. These triggers require
        the performing of a specific action of a specific type
        against a specific target, at the minimum, before they
        take effect. Examples of rare triggers include, but are
        not limited to, the following:
        Casting a lightning bolt at the chaos mage.
        Using the Decipher Script skill to decode a specific
        message.
        Reciting a particular piece of poetry while standing
        at a specific spot.
        The trigger goes off when a specified, rare
        environmental effect occurs, such as when snow falls
        in the jungle.
        Very Rare Triggers (DC -20)
        Very rare triggers require carefully worded conditions,
        lest they be doomed to never being triggered from the
        moment they are cast. Very rare triggers require a
        specific action be performed by a specific individual
        in either a specific location or against another,
        specified being. Examples of very rare triggers
        include, but are not limited to, the following:
        A specific warrior attacking the chaos mage with a
        specific type of weapon (for example, a sword).
        85
        CHAOS SORCERY
        A specific being reciting a particular piece of poetry
        at a specified location.
        The trigger goes off when a very specific
        environmental effect occurs in a specified location,
        such as when the first snow of winter falls on the
        rooftops of a certain castle.
        Triggers and Spell Duration
        The duration of a spell does not begin until its trigger
        has been tripped. At that point, the spell goes off as
        normal and its Duration element begins. A spell with
        a trigger will persist for one day per caster level, or
        until its trigger has been tripped. Should a caster
        wish to insure that his triggered spell last longer than
        that amount, he can add the following enhancement
        to the spell.
        Extend Dormancy (DC + 5)
        A spell effect which has extended dormancy will
        persist for one week per caster level, or until its
        trigger has been tripped.
        Triggers and the Limits of the Mortal
        Form
        The ability to use triggers to store spells is a powerful
        one and if not limited, can easily lead to chaos mages
        covering themselves and their allies with a
        veritable arsenal of ‘just in case’ dormant spell
        effects. Fortunately (in game balance terms) it
        is the nature of chaos to resist long confinement. A chaos mage can have only 1 dormant spell per
        2 caster levels at any one time, to a maximum of
        10 stored spells waiting to be triggered. A chaos
        mage can choose at any time to cancel a dormant
        effect, either to replace it with a new one, or to
        simply let it dissipate back into the ether.
        Using Chaos Magic
        Chaos magic spells are cast as a standard
        action. They are assumed to provoke attacks of
        opportunity, as more traditional spells do, and
        require verbal and somatic components, unless
        the spell weave is modified with the following
        option:
        Should a chaos mage so choose, he can reduce a
        spell’s casting check’s DC by increasing the time
        required to cast it. By increasing the casting
        time to a full round action, he reduces the casting
        check DC by 2. Every additional round, beyond the
        first, spent casting the spell decreases the casting
        check DC by 1, to a maximum reduction of –10.
        If the chaos mage is distracted while casting, his
        Concentration check DC is modified by the spell’s
        casting DC, rather than damage suffered. If he fails
        this check, he is also assumed to fail casting the
        spell.
        The Limits of Mind and
        Body
        Unlike more traditional arcane spellcasters, chaos
        mages are not chained and burdened down by the
        notion of spell slots, or a hard limit to the number
        of spells they can cast per day. In fact, chaos mages
        find those concepts downright alien, and view these
        limits as further proof (as if, to their minds, any more
        were needed!) that traditional mages are naught but
        children playing at adult games. Instead, chaos
        mages are limited by the strength of their own minds
        and bodies – even the most skilled practitioner of
        chaos magic must eventually bend to the endless,
        bruising assault of chaos.
        86
        CHAOS SORCERY
        Each time a chaos mage casts a spell, he suffers one
        point of damage for each five full points in the spell’s
        casting DC. This damage is applied immediately
        after the casting check is attempted, regardless of
        whether it was successful or not. If the casting check
        is successful, the damage is nonlethal, but if it is
        failed, the damage suffered is real.
        So, for example, casting a spell with a casting check
        DC of 12 will cause 2 points of damage, while a spell
        with a DC of 23 will cause 4 points, and so on. While
        nonlethal damage heals quickly, it still presents a
        very real limitation to the chaos mage; any chaos
        mage who is staggered or knocked unconscious
        by nonlethal damage from spellcasting cannot cast
        spells again until he has had at least eight hours of
        continuous, full rest.
        Concentration
        Some effect elements detailed earlier in this chapter
        are listed as requiring continuous concentration. Spells with this requirement can only be maintained
        by force of will, lest they lose coherence and sputter
        away. Spells which require continuous concentration
        exist only so long as the chaos mage dedicates a
        standard action to maintaining them.
        Maintenance of a spell does not provoke an attack
        of opportunity, but is otherwise considered a
        standard action in every way. Anything which can
        disrupt a spell during its casting can also disrupt the
        concentration required to maintain it, requiring the
        chaos mage to attempt a Concentration check as per
        the rules in Core Rulebook I. When determining the
        DC of the check, use the casting DC of the chaos
        spell being maintained as the basic difficulty and add
        modifiers as necessary.
        Characters concentrating on a spell cannot cast
        another, thought they may voluntarily drop their
        concentration, ending the spell immediately – there
        are no penalties for voluntarily ending a chaos magic
        spell. Should a character fail his Concentration
        check, however, he is stunned until his next action, as
        the chaos energy he fought so hard to maintain pours
        into his own body.
        Sample Spells
        It has been stated before, but it bears repeating here;
        chaos mages are not shackled by the concept of static
        spells. They reject formulae and rote incantation,
        instead embracing the freedom that comes from
        immersing oneself in the twining, shifting river of
        chaos, sculpting possibility with but a thought and a
        motion – this is why their spells are often referred to
        as weaves.
        With that in mind, we present the following
        chaos magic spells. These spells are intended to
        demonstrate what it is possible to create with the
        freeform spellcasting rules introduced in this book. Again, these spells are a demonstration of what is
        possible, not a comprehensive listing of every effect,
        and not a precise accounting of abilities. So if you
        find yourself defaulting to the samples which follow
        again and again, then your chaos magic is not being
        very chaotic.
        Remember also that the following spells are nothing
        more than loose collections of effects, arranged to
        create useful results, so while the in-game effects
        are magical, the numbers are not. Any of the sample
        spells can be changed to a significant degree simply
        by altering one element of the combination.
        Format
        The sample spells are presented in the following
        format:
        Spell Name
        Effect(s) Element – in the case of multiple effects,
        the effects will be listed in order from most to least
        expensive, with reduced cost effects displaying both
        their original casting DC, and their reduced DC.
        Area Element
        Range Element
        Duration Element
        Saving Throw Element
        Final Casting DC – including the complete formula
        for calculation.
        Following the listing of mechanical elements, a
        description of the spell’s intended effect will follow. In addition to this description, there will be a brief
        discussion of why that particular combination of
        elements was chosen, and how the spell might be
        altered by changing one or more elements.
        The sample spells are arranged according to
        their primary effect element, so that all spells
        87
        CHAOS SORCERY
        which concentrate on Direct Damage are grouped
        together, all Movement primary effects are grouped
        together and so on. You may recognise a few of the
        sample spells as similar in nature to existing static
        magic effects – this is intentional and designed to
        demonstrate how freeform magic can be used to
        replicate ‘standard’ spells.
        Direct Damage Effect
        Primary Weaves
        The following spells, though they may include
        other effects elements, are themed around inflicting
        damage to opponents.
        Ice Flowers
        Effect Element: Raw Damage effect, ice (DC 10
        +1)
        Area Element: Burst, modified with Enemies
        Only(DC +5 + 5)
        Range Element: Close (DC +1)
        Duration Element: Must be instantaneous
        Save Element: Standard
        Final Casting DC: 10 + 1 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 23
        An ice flowers spell is a fairly simple weaving,
        combining a Raw Damage effect with a Burst
        element, modified to attack Enemies Only. The spell manifests as jagged lumps of
        razor sharp ice, which erupt from the
        ground like blooming roses. At the current
        casting DC, it could conceivably be cast by
        even a 1st level chaos mage, though it will not be a
        reliable effect until much higher levels – for example,
        a 10th level caster with Wisdom 20 will have a bonus
        to his caster check of 10 + 5 = 15, meaning he will
        successfully cast the spell more than 50% of the
        time.
        In order to reduce the casting check DC to a level
        more acceptable to a less experienced caster, simply
        remove the ice Raw Damage and the Enemies Only
        area element modifiers, leaving a final casting DC of
        10 + 5 +1 = 16. To reduce it still further, cast the
        spell as a full round action, reducing it by -1 to a final
        casting DC of only 15, which a 1st level chaos mage
        with a Wisdom of 16 will achieve on a roll of 11 or
        higher on 1d20.
        Chaos Javelin
        Effect Element: Raw Damage effect (DC 10)
        Area Element: Single Target (default)
        Range Element: Medium (DC +5)
        Duration Element: Must be instantaneous
        Save Element: -1 penalty (DC +2)
        Final Casting DC: 10 + 5 + 2 = 17
        This is another simple chaos effect, in
        which the chaos mage summons
        up a long spear of chaos energy
        which streaks through the air to
        pierce the flesh of a single target. This Raw Damage effect is
        sufficient to cause serious
        damage, both because
        it can be used against
        88
        CHAOS SORCERY
        opponents at distances where they will be unable to
        retaliate effectively and because it imposes a penalty
        to saving throws against it.
        At the current casting DC, the chaos javelin will
        prove a reliable weapon beginning at about 5th level,
        when a chaos mage will be able to cast it roughly
        half of the time. Forgoing the saving throw penalty
        reduces the DC to 15, a number eminently attainable
        by even low level mages.
        An experienced chaos mage can increase the power of
        this effect by substituting a Degrading Damage effect
        for the Raw Damage, as it will inflict potentially
        more damage and only increase the casting DC by
        5 (necessary to add the By Round duration). In
        fact, spells like chaos javelin are the perfect vehicle
        for delivering Degrading Damage effects, as the
        target will not be able to be effectively retaliate as it
        continues to take damage each round.
        Chaos Dragon
        Effect Element: Degrading Damage, plus minor
        Domination effect (DC 10 +5)
        Area Element: Single Target (default)
        Range Element: Touch (DC +0)
        Duration Element: By Round (DC +5)
        Save Element: Standard
        Final Casting DC: 10 + 5 + 5 = 20
        The victim of the spell is buffeted with visions of
        the true nature and power of chaos; he is in effect
        suddenly exposed to the true nature of the universe. An unprepared mind so exposed to rampaging
        possibility cannot help but shrivel, and worse, cannot
        help but tear itself apart in its effort to escape.
        The psychic assault of a chaos dragon spell manifests
        as actual physical damage, pulling at the target’s
        psyche round after round. In addition, it forces an
        opponent who fails his save to flee for the duration
        of effect, as though he were frightened (will flee if
        possible, -2 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws,
        skill checks and ability checks).
        The minor Domination effect is considered mind-
        affecting, meaning that opponents who are immune
        to such effects will not be frightened, though they
        suffer damage from the chaos dragon as normal.
        A skilled chaos mage can slay or drive off multiple
        opponents with this effect, simply by adding a Burst
        effect and changing the range element to Close. This
        will increase the casting DC to 20 + 5 + 1 = 26, easily
        attainable by a chaos mage of mid to high level.
        Fiery Explosion
        Effect Element: Raw Damage + fire (DC 10 +1)
        Area Element: Burst (DC +5)
        Range Element: Close (DC +1)
        Duration Element: Instantaneous (default)
        Save Element: Standard (default)
        Final Casting DC: 10 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 17
        This is a chaos magic version of a standard fireball
        spell. Note that it is not the chaos magic version,
        as there are multiple ways to achieve the same,
        or a similar, effect. In some respects, this spell is
        more powerful than a standard fireball, in that it’s
        damage capacity is higher – a possible total of 20d8
        versus 10d6 for a traditional, non-metamagic altered
        fireball. On the other hand, the save DC of this spell
        is likely to be lower than the save DC of its static
        magic counterpart, a necessary trade off, considering
        the chaos mage can cast this spell as often as he
        chooses.
        As written, the DC of the spell is easily achievable
        by a 5th level chaos mage (with Wisdom of 16, the
        chaos mage would only need to roll a 9 or higher to
        cast the spell), the same level at which wizards gain
        access to traditional fireball spells. Should he wish,
        he can even forgo the fire element effect, lowering
        the casting DC even further and making the spell
        useful even against creatures who are resistant or
        invulnerable to fire.
        This spell demonstrates the astounding versatility
        of the chaos mage. Simply by altering the element
        of the damage effect, the caster can launch acid, or
        cold, or electricity, or even a sonic boom, permitting
        him to fine tune the spell weaving to take advantage
        of a creature’s weaknesses. Likewise, by altering
        the damage to a Degrading Damage effect and then
        adding a By Round duration effect, a high level caster
        can inflict immense amounts of damage. Finally, by
        adding an Enemies Only effect, he can fire this spell
        with abandon, even into the most chaotic melee,
        89
        CHAOS SORCERY
        something a more traditional spellcaster could never
        know.
        Push Blast
        Effect Element: Raw Damage + minor Movement
        (DC 10 + 5)
        Area Element: Single Target (default)
        Range Element: Close (DC +1)
        Duration Element: By round (DC +5)
        Save Element: Standard (default)
        Trigger: Uncommon (DC -10)
        Final Casting DC: 10 + 5 + 1 + 5 –10 = 11
        This spell couples a blast of Raw Damage with a
        minor Movement effect which pushes the target back
        20 feet + 5 feet per caster level. The spell is coupled
        with an uncommon trigger, sufficient to reduce
        the final casting DC to a very achievable 11. The
        uncommon trigger is this: once cast on a target, the
        spell only takes effect when and if the victim moves
        to attack the caster. Should that come to pass, the
        spell will go off immediately, at worst inflicting a fair
        amount of damage, at best inflicting great harm and
        throwing the aggressor out of melee range, buying the
        chaos mage time enough to flee, or prepare another
        spell.
        The uncommon trigger attached to this spell makes
        it useful even for low level chaos mages. A 1st level
        chaos mage with Wisdom 16 need only roll a 7 or
        better to successfully cast the spell, and can lower
        it even further if he adds another condition to the
        trigger, making it a rare trigger (DC -15). Perhaps he
        could modify to only take effect if the victim draws a
        melee weapon and moves to attack him.
        Conversely, a higher level chaos mage could forgo
        the trigger entirely – an 11th level chaos mage with
        Wisdom 20 can successfully cast a triggerless push
        blast on a roll of 5 or better.
        Ravenous Blast
        Effect Element: Raw Damage + Degrading Damage
        + minor Transformation (DC 10 + 5 + 5)
        Area Element: Cone (DC + 5)
        Range Element: Close (DC + 1)
        Duration Element: By Round (DC + 5)
        Save Element: Standard (default)
        Final Casting DC: 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 5 =31
        The ravenous blast is an example of a very powerful,
        multi-effect spell, combining two Damage effects
        with a minor Transformation effect. The immediate
        damage from the Raw Damage effect, coupled with
        the subsidiary Degrading Damage effect, is powerful
        enough to drop all but the hardiest foes – since only
        a chaos mage of 10th level or above can cast a spell
        combining three effects, the first round’s damage will
        be a minimum of 10d8 + 5d8 = 15d8. In addition,
        those who survive this initial blast and fail to save
        suffer the following, courtesy of the Transformation
        effect: their Constitution score is reduced by a
        minimum of 5 points, serving to further reduce their
        hit points and lower their chances of saving against
        the successive rounds of Degrading Damage.
        As printed, the ravenous blast has one serious
        downside: the final casting DC is prohibitively high
        for all but the highest level chaos mages. Even a 20th
        level chaos mage with Wisdom 22 will need to roll
        a 5 or better to cast the spell; good odds but by no
        means a guaranteed thing. Adding a common, or
        uncommon trigger to the spell will serve to bring the
        casting DC down without crippling its utility.
        On the other hand, a confident, high level chaos
        sorcerer might instead wish to add a saving throw

        For the Games Master – Creative Licence
        and the Use of Chaos Magic
        In and out of game, the success of chaos magic
        depends on the creativity of its wielders. A chaos
        mage who is not imaginative will not survive long
        and a chaos mage is only as imaginative as the
        player who controls him. In order to come into
        its own as a tool for creating exciting gaming,
        you must be prepared to allow your player’s
        imaginations free reign.
        While the base mechanics of chaos magic are
        straightforward, the exact outcomes of the many
        combinations of elements you and your players
        will create with it are not. This open-endedness
        can and will lead to the creation of truly bizarre
        spell effects, things that are only possible with a
        system as open to interpretation as this one. This
        is not a weakness of the chaos magic system, but
        its chief strength.
        When a player comes to you, the Games Master,
        with an idea about a truly unusual chaos spell,
        a good response will be ‘how can we make
        this work’ rather than ‘no’. Work with players
        to incorporate their off-the-cuff creativity as
        it encourages involved play; which leads to
        committed roleplaying.
        Working with players to incorporate creativity
        does not, however, mean rushing to accommodate
        their every whim and bizarre idea. You must
        be prepared to put your foot down, to say no
        to combinations which simply will not work in
        your game. Irresponsible use of ‘NO’ squashes
        creativity, responsible use squashes indulgence.
        penalty to the effect. A penalty of -2 adds only 5 to
        the final DC and a 20th level character with Wisdom
        22 will succeed at a DC 36 casting check on a roll of
        10 or better. A more cautious high level mage could
        add both a -4 saving throw penalty element (DC +10)
        and an uncommon trigger (DC -10) to the base spell,
        making the ravenous blast much more dangerous,
        with only a slight reduction in versatility.

        Primary Weaves
        The following spells, though they may include other
        effect elements, are themed around summoning and
        shaping chaos energy to affect opponents.

        Area Element: Burst (DC + 5)

        Duration Element: Instantaneous (default)
        Save Element: Standard (default)
        Final Casting DC: 5 + 5 + 1 = 11
        This very simplistic spell creates a brief flare of
        light, roughly equal in brightness to a candle. A
        spell like this is more versatile and useful than one
        might at first imagine, as it can be used to highlight
        targets (perhaps temporarily negating concealment
        or allowing allies another attempt to see opponents
        hidden in shadow), cause a brief distraction, or serve
        as a signal flare when the caster needs rescuing.
        Should the caster wish, he could remove the Burst
        effect, add a By Round element instead, and target
        a single opponent, creating an impromptu faerie fire
        spell. The DC of the spell would remain the same,
        and it would function as an excellent rogue-buster. As written, the casting DC of the spell is easily
        achievable by a 1st level chaos mage – with a Wisdom
        of 16, he need only roll a 7 to cast the spell. A clever
        chaos mage could lower to DC by 5 just by attaching
        a common trigger to the effect – perhaps the spell
        only goes off if a living being moves through the
        area of effect, making the spell useful as an early
        warning.
        Retributive Armour
        Effect Element: Minor Materialisation + Persistent
        Damage (DC 10 + 3)
        Area Element: Single Target (default)
        Range Element: Personal (default)
        Duration Element: By round (DC + 5)
        Save Element: N/A
        Trigger: Uncommon (DC -10)
        Final Casting DC: 10 + 3 + 5 – 10 = 8
        Through the use of this combination of elements,
        the chaos mage can call up a protective suit of chaos
        energy which also serves to punish those with the
        temerity to strike him in combat. When the caster
        is attacked in melee combat, this spell causes raw
        chaos energy to mold itself to his vital points. Simultaneously, it fires a blast of pure chaos into the
        aggressor, damage which continues to be inflicted
        over the course of several rounds. The exact strength
        of the effect depends on the level of the caster – a
        1st level caster will gain only a +1 bonus to Armour
        91
        CHAOS SORCERY
        to be a magical weapon for the purposes of piercing
        damage reduction.
        The uncommon trigger attached to this spell limits it
        to being cast only on a being who has been attacked
        in combat.
        Spider Construct
        Effect Element: Chaos Construct (moderate) +
        Moderate Movement + Persistent Damage (DC 25
        + 8 + 3)
        Area Element: Burst (DC + 5)
        Range Element: Close (DC + 1)
        Duration Element: By round (DC + 5)
        Save Element: Standard (default)
        Trigger: Rare (DC – 15)
        Final Casting DC: 25 + 8 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 5 – 15 = 32
        Spider construct is an example of a very powerful
        Materialisation effect. When the spell takes effect, it
        creates a chaos construct (the chaos construct effect)
        that is capable of climbing vertical surfaces (moderate
        Movement) and delivering a single, powerful chaos-
        based Touch attack (Persistent Damage).
        This sort of spell is very useful as a warding
        enchantment, as the chaos construct is a very effective
        guardian. A high level chaos mage might have one or
        more of these spider constructs cast near the windows
        and doors leading to his sleeping chamber, the better
        to discourage (meaning kill) unwanted intruders.
        The rare trigger placed on the spell restricts the spell
        to activating only when an unknown being bearing
        weapons passes through the radius of effect.
        The casting DC of the spider construct spell restricts
        its to use to highly skilled chaos mages. Fortunately,
        as these spells are usually only used to create
        guardians, the caster can afford to stretch the casting
        time out over several rounds, reducing the casting DC
        to a more easily achievable number.
        Movement Effect
        Primary Weaves
        The following spells, though they may include other
        effect elements, are themed around travel.
        Spider Walk
        Effect Element: Moderate Movement (DC 15)
        Area Element: Single Target (default)
        Class, and inflict only 1d8 points of damage, while
        the same spell cast by a 10th level chaos mage will
        provide a +5 bonus to Armour Class, and inflict a
        total of 10d8 damage over the course of 4 rounds.
        The uncommon trigger of this spell is the requirement
        that the mage must be attacked by a melee weapon in
        combat.
        The casting DC of this spell is low enough that a 1st
        level caster with Wisdom 16 need only roll a 4 or
        better to successfully cast a spell, while a 4th level
        caster with the same Wisdom will only fail on a
        natural 1. At that level, the caster might better be
        served to change the Persistent Damage to a Raw
        Damage element – for a DC increase of only 5, the
        character will inflict a larger amount of damage in
        a single strike, which is useful when facing tougher
        foes.
        Note that the Persistent Damage effect attached to
        this spell works only once, when the spell first flares
        to life, as it is an instantaneous effect. The armour
        remains for the full duration.
        Black Sword
        Effect Element: Moderate Materialisation + Raw
        Damage (DC 15 + 5)
        Area Element: Single Target (default)
        Range Element: Close (DC + 1)
        Duration Element: By round (DC + 5)
        Save Element: Standard (default)
        Trigger: Uncommon (DC – 10)
        Final Casting DC: 15 + 5 + 1 + 5 – 10 = 16
        This rather esoteric weaving allows the chaos mage
        to summon up a magical sword and generate pure
        chaos energy through it. Because the spell has a
        Close range element attached, the chaos mage need
        not wield the sword himself. Typically, a spell like
        this would be used to give an ally a weapon capable
        of inflicting great harm against a powerful foe.
        Once activated, the spell creates a melee weapon (it
        need not be a sword), which appears, ready to be
        used, in the target’s hands. The first blow delivered
        by the sword unleashes the subsidiary Raw Damage
        effect, meaning the first blow may well be the only
        blow. The power of a moderate Transformation
        effect is such that the created weapon is considered
        92
        CHAOS SORCERY
        Range Element: Touch (default)
        Duration Element: By Round (DC + 5)
        Save Element: Standard (default)
        Final Casting DC: 15
        Spider walk is a chaos magic version of static magic’s
        spider climb spell. As written, the spell allows the
        recipient to walk up walls and across ceilings at their
        normal movement rate, for a number of rounds equal
        to the chaos mage’s caster level. As you can see by
        the final casting DC, chaos magic Movement effect
        spells are slightly less efficient than their static magic
        counterparts – while a 3rd level wizard can unerringly
        cast a spider climb spell that will last him a full half
        hour, a 3rd level chaos mage with a Wisdom of 16 will
        need to roll a 9 or better on his casting check to cast
        the spell, and even then it will last him only three
        rounds.
        That said, this spell does have a few advantages over
        its static magic equivalent. First, rather than gain a flat
        climb speed of 20 feet per round, the recipient of this
        spell can move his full normal movement rate, which
        can be a considerable tactical advantage. Second, by
        adding a Burst area element to his spell (increasing
        the DC by 5), the chaos mage can grant all his allies
        the same ability to climb that he enjoys, without the
        need to waste multiple, precious spell slots.
        While the initial casting DC of this spell may seem
        prohibitive, keep in mind that when the chaos mage
        and his friends are not in a particular hurry, such as
        when they are preparing to scale a castle wall, there
        is no reason he cannot spend a few extra rounds
        preparing his weaving – ten full rounds of preparation
        will lower the casting DC to only 5.
        Push Wave
        Effect Element: Minor Movement (DC 10)
        Area Element: Burst (DC + 5)
        Range Element: Touch (DC + 0)
        Duration Element: Instantaneous (default)
        Save Element: Standard (default)
        Final Casting DC: 10 + 5 + 0 = 15
        The push wave is an example of a defensive Movement
        effect. Ideal for self preservation, the spell creates a
        pulse of chaos energy which pushes everything in
        its path away from the caster, to a distance of 20
        feet + 5 feet per caster level. The casting DC of the
        spell is such that even a low level caster can succeed
        with a majority of his castings, particularly if he has
        the foresight to cast the spell before entering melee
        combat.
        This spell as written has two downsides. First, it does
        not distinguish between friends and foes, although
        this problem can be eliminated if the caster modifies
        the spell to effect Enemies Only (DC + 5). Second,
        enemies which succeed at their Will save will not be
        thrown back – this may or may not be a problem, as
        the majority of melee oriented foes will have a low
        Will save.
        Surprise Journey
        Effect Element: Minor Movement (DC 10)
        Area Element: Two Targets (DC + 3)
        Range Element: Close (DC + 1)
        Duration Element: Instantaneous (default)
        Save Element: Standard (default)
        Final Casting DC: 10 + 3 + 1 = 14
        This useful trick allows the caster to instantly cause
        two living beings to switch locations with one
        another, the better to catch enemies by surprise, or
        remove allies from deadly peril. For the spell to work
        properly, the caster need merely designate two targets
        – if both fail their save (or one or both choose to forgo
        the save attempt), they instantly trade positions.
        This spell is especially useful for creating, or foiling,
        flanking situations; a caster surrounded by two
        (or more) opponents can, upon casting this spell,
        instantly send himself outside their ranks, a tactic
        which works especially well if he cast the spell
        before combat begins and designates being flanked
        as a trigger (uncommon DC -10). Alternately, a
        clever chaos mage could use the spell to send one
        of his more martially inclined partners into his
        enemy’s ranks, while bringing one of their more
        fragile members (perhaps a wizard?) into reach of his
        remaining allies.
        The DC of this spell is low enough that the caster
        could alter the save element, perhaps to a -2 to saves
        (DC +5) to better insure that his targets move as he
        desires. This is an especially good idea if he intends
        to cast the spell on himself, as a preventative measure
        against flanking situations – given that he can cast the
        spell ahead of time, the increase in DC will ultimately
        mean little.
        93
        CHAOS SORCERY
        Ghost Passage
        Effect Element: Moderate Movement, Negligible
        Materialisation (DC 15 + 2)
        Area Element: Single Target (default)
        Range Element: Personal (default)
        Duration Element: By Round (DC + 5)
        Save Element: Standard
        Final Casting DC: 15 + 2 + 5 = 22
        This spell weaving allows the caster to move as
        silently and invisibly as the wind. The moderate
        Movement effect allows the caster to travel a fair
        distance, while the Negligible Materialisation effect
        renders him immune to non-magical sight.
        This spell is very effective as an intrusion device,
        and is also useful when the mage finds himself in
        need of a quick escape. While the casting DC of
        the spell is steep, a low level mage who dedicates
        a few extra rounds to creating the enchantment will
        be able to reduce the DC to easily achieved levels. A 2nd level mage who dedicates a full 10 rounds to
        the casting will reduce the DC to only 12. If he has
        a Wisdom score of 16, he need only roll a 7 or better
        to successfully cast the spell and judicious use of a
        common trigger could reduce it even further.
        Domination Effect
        Primary Weaves
        The following spells, though they may include other
        effect elements, are themed around influencing and
        controlling minds.
        Charm Crowd
        Effect Element: Minor Domination (DC 10)
        Area Element: Spread (DC + 10)
        Range Element: Close (DC + 1)
        Duration Element: By Minute (DC + 10)
        Save Element: Standard
        Final Casting DC: 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 31
        This powerful and notoriously difficult spell allows
        the chaos mage to temporarily harvest a small army
        of admirers, minions and ‘friends’. Those who fail to
        save view the caster in the most favourable light, and
        treat him as though he were an old and dear friend –
        while they do not instantly obey his commands, they
        will certainly strongly consider his suggestions and
        will not hesitate to stand up for him if necessary. In
        essence, the spell functions as a mass charm monster
        spell, save that it is not limited to a set number of Hit
        Dice.
        As listed, the final casting DC of the spell is quite
        prohibitive to all but the most experienced casters
        (though it is commensurate to its strength). A 15th
        level caster with Wisdom 24 will have a reasonable
        chance of success, needing only a 9 or better on his
        casting check, but lower level casters will find their
        odds of successfully using this spell to be risky at
        best. In order to up their chances of success, lower
        level casters might reducethe duration to By Round
        (reducing the DC by 5), change the area element
        to Cone or Burst (reducing the DC by 5), or both
        (reducing the DC to only 21).
        Fear and Flame
        Effect Element: Minor Domination, Persistent
        Damage with fire (DC 10 + 3 + 1)
        Area Element: Burst (DC + 5)
        Range Element: Personal Immunity ( DC + 2)
        Duration Element: By Round (DC + 5)
        Save Element: Standard (default)
        Trigger: Uncommon (DC – 10)
        94
        CHAOS SORCERY
        Final Casting DC: 10 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 5 – 10 = 16
        This useful effect is a great defensive enhancement
        for a chaos mage who expects to find himself in
        combat. When he is attacked in melee combat
        (the uncommon trigger), the spell flares to life,
        surrounding him in a cocoon of magical chaos flame. Those enveloped in the flames, save the caster (he
        paid for immunity), begin to burn and continue to
        do so for several rounds. More importantly, they are
        driven senseless by the pain and are stunned for the
        duration of the spell.
        Fear and flame is a relatively powerful effect,
        capable of wreaking havoc on a large number
        of foes. Unfortunately, while the caster enjoys
        personal immunity, his allies do not. A mage who is
        adventuring with a group should consider forgoing
        the immunity for the area element enhancement
        Enemies Only (DC + 5). While doing so raises the
        DC to 19 (since he can forgo his personal immuntiy),
        it makes it much more useful to a typical adventuring
        chaos mage.
        As it stands, the casting DC of this spell is low enough
        that a mid-level chaos mage should have no trouble
        getting it to work when he needs it (particularly if he
        has the foresight to cast the spell before engaging in
        battle). Those who feel confident in their ability to
        twist chaos to their whims might add a penalty to the
        saving throw, ensuring that their enemies will bathe
        in flames.
        Faux Pas
        Effect Element: Negligible Domination (DC 5)
        Area Element: Single target (default)
        Range Element: Close (DC + 1)
        Duration Element: Single round (DC + 2)
        Save Element: -2 to saves (DC + 5)
        Trigger: Uncommon (DC -10)
        Final Casting DC: 5 + 1 + 2 + 5 – 10 = 3
        Not all battles are won with force of arms. The aptly
        named faux pas weaving seems an inconsequential
        spell, but in the hands of a devious chaos mage, it
        can accomplish more than a well-placed sword ever
        could. The faux pas spell allows the caster to force
        the victim to perform some potentially embarrassing
        action, so long as that action takes place in a social
        setting. The exact nature of that action is up to the
        caster; he might make the victim belch loudly in the
        king’s face, he might make him speak a blasphemous
        phrase in front of the mother superior, or cause him to
        put his hands in inappropriate, and intimate, places,
        or simply cause him to stammer at an inopportune
        moment. In any case, the action is minor. The effect
        is social suicide.
        This particular weaving is created to be as easily cast
        as possible. The caster need not touch the victim,
        ensuring that he can use his spell when he needs
        it. Likewise, the penalty to the victim’s save helps
        insure that the spell will take effect – critical in a
        social encounter, where the moment, once passed,
        never comes again. Even the uncommon trigger
        helps insure the spell takes effect only when it counts;
        this particular trigger requires the victim be within
        touching distance of the one who is to be offended,
        since it just would not do to have the wine spilled in
        the wrong duke’s lap.
        The Negligible Domination effect that powers this
        spell cannot be used to cause the victim to commit
        violence of any sort, as it does not have that kind of
        power. Note that this expressly does not mean that
        violence will not ensue as a result of this spell; never
        underestimate the danger in an improperly placed
        hand.
        Safe Capture
        Effect Element: Extraordinary Domination, minor
        Movement (DC 20 + 5)
        Area Element: Single Target (default)
        Range Element: Close (DC + 1)
        Duration Element: By Round (DC + 5)
        Save Element: Standard (default)
        Final Casting DC: 20 + 5 + 1 + 5 = 31
        This exceptionally nasty spell weave allows a chaos
        mage to both teleport an enemy and, more importantly,
        crush the pathways of his mind, reducing him to the
        mental faculties of an infant. The victim temporarily
        loses one point of both Intelligence and Wisdom
        for each caster level the chaos mage possesses, to a
        minimum score of 1 in each.
        The complimentary powers of the two effects
        contained within this spell make it especially useful
        in capturing opponents. After all, there is little that
        a drooling simpleton can do to escape a chaos mage
        and his allies, especially if they bind him with spells
        and rope before his intellect returns. Should this spell
        be used against an enemy which cannot be effectively
        95
        CHAOS SORCERY
        Beauty and the Beast version 2.0
        We have spoken at length about the mechanical
        versatility of chaos magic and how specific
        results can be achieved through many different
        combinations of elements. Here is where we put
        our money where our mouth is. What follows is a
        different version of the minor Transformation weave
        beauty and the beast, which achieves strikingly
        similar results via a very different path.
        Beauty and the Beast
        Effect Element: Moderate Materialisation (DC 15)
        Area Element: Single Target (default)
        Range Element: Close (DC + 1)
        Duration Element: By Minute (DC + 10)
        Save Element: Standard (default)
        Trigger: Uncommon (DC -10)
        Final Casting DC: DC 15 + 1 + 10 – 10 = 16
        This version of the beauty and the beast spell uses
        illusion, rather than actual physical transformation,
        to punish those who choose falsehood over truth. Unlike the first version of the spell, this one does
        not effect an actual physical transformation, nor
        does it reduce the victim’s Charisma score. Instead,
        it cloaks him in the hideous visage of a beast, an
        illusionary disfigurement which grows worse with
        each successive lie.
        There are advantages and disadvantages to both
        versions of the spell. The original version is limited
        to only a single transformation, meaning the spell
        reacts only to the first lie spoken. Conversely, while
        the spell is limited to detecting only one lie, it is
        more effective as a punitive measure, since it carries
        with it an actual mechanical penalty, in the form of a
        Charisma drain – this drain does make it somewhat
        easier to detect the victim’s lies, since his Bluff
        check will suffer as his Charisma score drops.
        This version of the spell, meanwhile, lacks the
        physical punch of the original, but has the advantage
        of continually reacting to each lie as it is spoken,
        shrouding the liar in ever more disgusting images. The other advantage of the spell is its ability to
        circumvent the liar’s natural Charisma, at least in
        regards to how visually unappealing he becomes;
        since the illusion is not limited to simply roughening
        or exaggerating the liar’s natural physical attributes,
        he can be cursed to display any repugnant shape
        chaos can envision.
        captured, or safely held, the caster could increase the
        Movement effect of the weave to major (DC +10,
        rather than +5) and transport his hapless enemy as
        far away as possible, the better to buy time to effect a
        quick escape before addled wits return.
        Safe capture can also be used in a more insidious
        fashion, though it requires a ruthless will to
        implement. Imagine, if you will, what would happen
        if you put a victim with the mind of an infant on the
        edge of a cliff, or perched him in front of a raging
        monster, or simply teleported him into the moat.
        As written, the casting DC of safe capture limits its
        use to mid to high level. To be used effectively at
        lower levels, a trigger of at least uncommon strength
        should be added.
        Transformation
        Effect Primary Spells
        The following spells, though they may include other
        effect elements, are themed around altering the
        essential nature, of living and non-living matter.
        Beauty and the Beast
        Effect Element: Minor Transformation (DC 10)
        Area Element: Single Target (default)
        Range Element: Close (DC + 1)
        Duration Element: By Minute (DC + 10)
        Save Element: Standard (default)
        Trigger: Uncommon (DC – 10)
        Final Casting DC: 10 + 1 + 10 – 10 = 11
        This potent spell is both the strictest teacher and the
        most vindictive disciplinarian you could ever imagine. The chaos energy woven into this spell seeps into the
        victim’s bones and stays there, dormant, until such
        time as the victim creatively interprets the facts,
        speaks a falsehood, or stretches the truth; in other
        words, when he lies (the uncommon trigger), the
        spell makes him pay. When and if the lie occurs, the
        spell instantly reduces his Charisma by 1 point per
        two caster levels as he becomes increasingly bestial
        and hideous.
        This spell is a good example of a more fantastical,
        fairy-tale effect, the sort of spell a chaos mage with
        a bent for illusion might prefer. It is also good as an
        impromptu lie detector, since there is no hiding the
        changes wrought by this spell.
        The casting DC of beauty and the beast is low enough
        that even low level chaos mages can cast it with little
        risk, but its effects keep it useful throughout all the
        way through the highest levels of play.
        96
        CHAOS SORCERY
        Living Art
        Effect Element: Chaotic Reconstruction, Major
        Materialisation, Major Domination, Minor
        Transformation (DC 30 + 10 + 8 + 8)
        Area Element: Single Target, (default)
        Range Element: Touch (DC + 0)
        Duration Element: By Round, plus secondary By
        Round (DC + 5 + 3)
        Save Element: Standard (default)
        Trigger: Very Rare (DC – 20)
        Final Casting DC: 30 + 10 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 5 + 3 – 20
        = 34
        This combination of elements is a good example
        of an extraordinarily powerful, thoroughly abstract
        chaos spell weave, exactly the sort of esoteric effect
        chaos magic is infamous for. This bizarre spell
        transforms those it is cast upon into visual and/or
        aural representations of their current mood and their
        beliefs.
        The spell manifests in one of the following three
        fashions, as chosen by the caster:
        † The subject is transformed into written words
        in a book, taking the form of a poem, legend,
        myth or other creative work. The work is fully
        illustrated and written in beautiful, spidery letters. The book is written in the primary language of the
        transformed party, though the caster of the spell
        can read them even if he is not literate in that
        tongue. For the duration of the spell, those who
        wish to can peruse the book, reading the work as
        they would any other.
        † The subject is transformed into a work of
        sculpture, or a painting, or a tapestry. Regardless
        of the medium, the work is of exquisite quality,
        surpassing anything but the most capable mortal
        hands could make.
        † The subject is transformed into an invisible
        symphony of exquisite tone, or into a choir made
        up of dozens or hundreds of phantom voices, all
        singing in the subject’s native tongue.
        The exact expression of the work depends on the
        nature and interests of the one transformed, so that
        a grim, brooding warrior will appear as a tapestry
        depicting a great battle, while a light-hearted duellist
        might become a bawdy comedy. Note that the
        expression of the work is keyed to the true nature
        of the subject, not to the personality they show the
        world, so that the brooding warrior would actually
        manifest as a romantic saga (albeit a violent one), if
        he were actually a romantic at heart.
        While in one of the above listed forms, the
        transformed being remains fully aware, but is unable
        to interact with the world and may take no actions.
        Regardless of which of the
        three forms is chosen, when
        the spell ends, the subject is
        returned to its original form,
        with full recollection of what
        occurred while transformed and
        full recollection of the work it
        became. The experience of being
        transformed into an exquisite
        work of art is refreshing to the
        mind, body and soul, so that upon
        resuming its normal form, the
        subject’s Charisma is temporarily
        increased by +1 per two caster
        levels, to a maximum of +5.
        97
        CHAOS FAMILIARS
        Chaos
        Familiars
        The chaos mage is destined to spend much of
        his life apart from mortal companionship,
        particularly when he begins to succumb
        to the more hideous and destructive deformities
        of the Paths of Chaos. Those chaos mages who
        manage to forge strong bonds with adventuring
        companions, or especially understanding lovers, do
        not face the absolute crushing depths of solitude
        their less fortunate brethren do, but even they must
        occasionally despair of finding someone who truly
        understands their burden, and their beliefs.
        Chaos is possibility fulfilled. It hears the siren call
        of its wielder’s despair and though not benevolent, it
        provides for the possibility of their happiness.
        This possibility takes the form of the chaos familiar. Chaos familiars are sentient constructs, made when a
        chaos mage sacrifices a piece of his own essence and
        personality to quicken, sculpt and awaken raw chaos
        energy. As a result of this sacrifice, chaos familiars
        are stronger and more versatile than their static magic
        counterparts.
        Crafting the Familiar At second level, or at any point thereafter, the chaos
        mage can choose to bring life to his chaos familiar. There is no equipment required to do this, nor does
        the chaos mage need to mumble arcane words or burn
        exotic incense. Instead, he need merely sit quietly for
        a full day, mentally shaping the desired form of his
        familiar to be. At the end of that time, if the mage has
        been left undisturbed, his familiar appears, carving
        itself free from the empty air.
        The familiar’s actual appearance is left to the
        discretion of the player and the Games Master. All
        familiars appear supernatural in nature, with strange
        colourings, glittering skin or molten eyes clearly
        attesting to their otherworldly origin. Beyond that
        restriction, there are an infinite variety of shapes
        which may be chosen, from simple round balls of
        amorphous flesh, to miniature elephants made from
        tiny brass bells, to angels with a dragonfly’s wings
        and a peacock’s plumage.
        The following rules will help you decide the exact
        nature and abilities of your familiar.
        Base Abilities
        The chaos familiar is an extension and reflection
        of its creator, sharing many of his strengths and
        weaknesses. All of the familiar’s initial ability scores
        are equal to one half those of its creator, rounding
        up. An additional number of ability score points
        equal to the chaos mage’s class level are then added. The familiar’s ability scores do not increase as the
        character’s do and they are not affected by spells,
        spell-like effects or magic items which are used to
        artificially boost the chaos mage’s attributes. Every
        time he increases his chaos mage level, an additional
        ability score point is added to the familiar. Note that
        no familiar may increase its Intelligence, Wisdom or
        Charisma scores beyond its master’s score in that
        ability.
        Chaos familiars share many of their master’s
        personality traits as well, though they are uniformly
        exaggerated, in some cases almost to the point of
        parody. They are also classic enablers, forever urging
        their masters to cast one more spell, to twine one more
        effect to each casting, to reach beyond themselves to
        touch the glory that is unrestricted possibility.
        Skills
        At the time of their creation, chaos familiars gain a
        total number of skill points equal to their master’s
        Wisdom score. This number of skill points increases
        as the mage’s Wisdom does, with new points assigned
        to existing skills as outlined below. No one skill from
        the following list may have more than the mage’s
        class level +3 assigned to it.
        † Balance
        † Climb
        † Escape Artist
        † Hide
        † Listen
        † Move Silently
        98
        CHAOS FAMILIARS
        † Search
        † Spot
        † Swim
        † Any 1 class skill the chaos mage possesses
        Feats
        The chaos familiar gains one feat at the time of
        creation, chosen from the list below.
        † Agile
        † Alertness
        † Athletic
        † Combat Reflexes
        † Dodge (master must have Dex 13+)
        † Great Fortitude
        † Improved Initiative
        † Iron Will
        † Lightning Reflexes
        † Stealthy
        † Toughness
        † Weapon Focus (natural weapons)
        Special Abilities
        Chaos familiars gain one special ability at creation
        and an additional special ability for every 5 full chaos
        mage class levels thereafter. So, the chaos familiar
        of a 10th level chaos mage would have two special
        abilities, while the familiar of a 20th level mage would
        have four.
        Additional Feat – In lieu of selecting a special
        ability, the chaos familiar gains another feat, chosen
        from the options presented above.
        Bolster Saves – If within 20 feet of its creator, the
        familiar can, as a free action, voluntarily lower its
        saving throws to increase those of its creator. For
        every two points by which the familiar lowers its
        save, it grants its master a +1 inherent bonus to that
        save, for a period of one round. This ability can be
        used as often as the familiar chooses, but only one
        save may be modified at a time. This ability can be
        selected twice. The second time it is chosen, it allows
        the familiar to increase its master’s saves on a one-
        for-one basis and the effective range is extended to
        25 feet.
        Bolster Will – By partially fusing its mind with that
        of its creator, the chaos familiar can assist with the
        casting of chaos magic. So long as the familiar is
        in physical contact with the chaos mage, he gains a
        +2 enhancement bonus to all casting checks. This
        means, however, that any damage caused by the
        casting of the spell is applied to both the caster and
        familiar (both receive the full amount of damage
        incurred, it is not split). Triggering this ability is a
        full round action for the familiar, which must be done
        the round before the chaos mage begins to cast a spell
        so that he receives the benefits. This ability may not
        be selected if the Damage Division ability has been
        selected. This ability can be selected twice. The
        second time it is chosen, it reduces the time necessary
        to trigger the ability to a standard action and allows
        the ability to work so long as the chaos familiar is
        within 5 feet of the chaos mage.
        Brainburn Poison – Three times a day, the chaos
        familiar can inject a dose of poison into an enemy
        when it deals damage in melee combat. The poison
        causes 1d4 points of initial temporary Intelligence
        damage, with secondary damage of 1d2 points
        temporary Intelligence damage. A fortitude save
        against a DC of 10 + one-half the chaos mage’s caster
        level is required to resist the poison. This special
        ability can be selected twice. The second time it is
        chosen, it allows the familiar to launch the poison in
        a line 10 feet long and increases the base save to 12 +
        one-half the caster’s level.
        Breath Weapon – The chaos familiar can, once per
        day, breathe a cone of devastating chaos energy. The
        cone is 5 feet + 5 feet per five of its master’s caster
        levels long and inflicts 1d6 points of anarchic damage
        per two of its master’s caster levels. A Reflex save
        against a DC of 10 + one-half the chaos mage’s caster
        level halves the damage. This ability can be selected
        twice. The second time it is selected, it gives the
        familiar the ability to use its breath weapon three
        times per day and the cone is 10 feet + 5 feet per five
        of its master’s caster levels long.
        Damage Division – When within 10 feet of its creator,
        the familiar can absorb damage that would otherwise
        harm the chaos mage. The chaos mage may do this as
        99
        CHAOS FAMILIARS
        often as he likes, simply by deducting lost hit points
        from his familiar instead of himself. This ability can
        be used to absorb either nonlethal or normal damage,
        but cannot be used to absorb the damage caused by
        casting chaos magic. This ability may not be selected
        if the Bolster Will ability has been selected. This
        ability can be selected twice. The second time it is
        selected, it doubles the effective range to 20 feet and
        allows the chaos familiar to absorb damage caused by
        the casting of chaos magic effects.
        Damage Reduction – The familiar gains damage
        reduction 5/law. While in physical contact with its
        creator, it can, once per day as a free action, extend
        this protection to its master for a number of rounds
        equal to one half the mage’s caster level. This ability
        can be selected twice. The second time it is chosen
        it increases the damage reduction to 7/law and allows
        the familiar to extend this protection to its master
        an once more per day.
        Extra Movement Type – The familiar gains a
        second movement type, selected from the list. This ability can be selected up to three times,
        giving the familiar access to a third and fourth
        type of movement.
        Increased Attack Bonus – The familiar attacks
        with the base attack bonus of a bard of its
        master’s chaos mage class level. This ability can
        be selected twice. The second time it is chosen,
        it improves the familiar’s base attack bonus to
        that of a fighter of its master’s class level.
        Invisibility – The familiar can become invisible
        three times per day as a free action. Its
        invisibility lasts a number of rounds equal to the
        chaos mage’s caster level and ends the moment
        the familiar attacks, casts a spell, or performs a
        similar action. This special ability is functionally
        identical to the invisibility spell. This ability can
        be selected twice. The second time it is chosen,
        it allows the familiar to become invisible at will,
        subject to the restrictions outlined above.
        Resistance – The familiar is especially resistant
        to certain types of damage. It gains energy
        resistance equal to its master’s class level against
        one of the following types of energy; acid, cold,
        electricity, fire or sonic. This resistance protects
        against both normal and magical versions of those
        energy types. This ability can be selected twice. The
        second time it allows the familiar to select a second
        energy form to be resistant to, and also allows him
        to extend his protection to his master once a day, for
        up to half the chaos mage’s caster level in rounds, so
        long as the two are in physical contact.
        Spell Conduit – By building a strong bond between
        himself and his familiar, a chaos mage is able to
        project his powers over far greater distances than
        normal. When in possession of a familiar with this
        ability, the practitioner may cast a chaos magic
        spell through the familiar – in terms of range, touch
        attacks, and area of effect, the familiar effectively
        100
        CHAOS FAMILIARS
        becomes the caster of the spell, though all other
        variables of the spell, such as caster level, remain as
        the chaos mage’s. The familiar must be with 5 feet +
        5 feet per point of Wisdom bonus of the caster to use
        this ability.
        Movement Type
        A chaos familiar possesses one of the following
        movement types, as selected by the chaos mage.
        † Walk – base speed 10 feet + 5 feet per point of
        Wisdom bonus.
        † Flight (average) – base speed 10 feet + 5 feet per
        two points of Wisdom bonus. The familiar may
        also walk at a speed of 5 feet per round.
        † Swim – base speed 10 feet + 5 feet per point of
        Wisdom bonus. The familiar can also walk at a
        speed of 5 feet per round.
        † Burrow – base speed 5 feet + 5 feet per point of
        Wisdom bonus. The familiar can also walk at a
        base speed of 10 feet per round.
        Other Features
        The following features are common to all chaos
        familiars.
        † Familiars begin at Tiny size, and increase to
        Small size after the caster has gained 5 levels of
        experience (or begin at Small size if the caster is 7th
        level or above when he creates him). This growth
        increases the familiar’s Strength by +4, as well as
        altering him as per the rules for size increase found
        in Core Rulebook I.
        † Familiars have Hit Dice equal to one half their
        master’s chaos mage level, rounded down.
        † The familiar has exactly one half the original hit
        points of its master, rounding down. Modifiers
        due to either the familiar’s or master’s Constitution
        score have no effect on the familiar’s hit points.
        † The familiar has a single attack form (claws,
        stinger, horn, bite, punch or other exotic attack). It attacks with a base attack bonus equal to that
        of a wizard of its creator’s chaos mage level. The
        attack causes 1d4 damage, which increases to 1d6
        damage when the familiar becomes Small sized.
        † The familiar and its master can communicate via
        telepathy or via normal speech. The telepathy has
        a range of 1 mile + 1 mile per point of Wisdom
        bonus. The familiar willingly obeys its master’s
        orders, to the point of rushing to certain death if so
        directed. None other than the creator chaos mage
        can understand the strange, flowing language
        of the familiar – it speaks the currents of chaos,
        which mortal minds cannot comprehend.
        † Familiars have good Fortitude, Reflex and Will
        saves, calculated as though they were a character
        of their master’s chaos mage level. These are
        modified by the familiar’s Dexterity, Constitution
        and Wisdom scores as normal.
        † Familiars have a base Armour Class equal to 10 +
        their master’s Wisdom bonus + one-half his class
        level.
        † Whenever a chaos mage achieves a new chaos
        mage level, the chaos familiar raises an ability
        score by one point. The familiar cannot have an
        Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma score higher
        than its master’s, however.
        Death
        A chaos familiar is a very real part of the chaos
        mage and he can no more ignore its loss than he
        could ignore the loss of an arm. The two are bonded
        on a fundamental level, and the loss of one almost
        assuredly slays the other.
        Should the chaos mage be slain, his familiar remains
        for a number of rounds equal to its deceased master’s
        class level. During this time, it will attempt to revive
        its master if possible, or attack its master’s killers if
        not. At the end of the last round of its existence, it
        dissipates in a brief implosion of energy. Should the
        chaos mage be later returned to life, he must craft a
        new familiar.
        If the familiar is slain, the chaos mage is instantly
        reduced to 0 hit points, and is considered disabled. If
        he receives healing and survives, he will never be as
        healthy again; the chaos mage’s Constitution score is
        permanently reduced by one point. In addition, the
        moment the familiar is slain, the chaos mage must
        immediately roll to see if he takes a step along a Path
        of Chaos, just as though he had suffered a backlash.
        101
        TOOLS OF THE TRADE
        Tools of the
        Trade
        Chaos mages are self-sufficient. They have to
        be, as those who practice the craft for long
        quickly fall to physical and mental deformities
        that make it impossible for them to interact with other
        people. Even their closest companions and dearest
        loved ones will eventually come to shun them. People
        recognise that the vocation of chaos is a voluntary
        one; if the magician would sacrifice his humanity for
        power, who else would he destroy?
        Isolated and alone, the chaos mage must turn to the
        crafts of chaos for everyday activaties. He cannot buy
        clothing that will fit his deformed body at a tailor’s.
        No farrier will help him with his horse. Common
        food tastes like coffin rot on his tongue. In order to
        address these problems he turns to the infinite power
        of his magic. The more he dips into this well – the
        more he uses his power instead of common means
        – the more addicted he becomes and the greater his
        deformities.
        This chapter is broken down into two sections. The
        first introduces the complete rules necessary for chaos
        mages to begin crafting their own magic items, from
        initial concept to final infusion. The section closes
        with a diverse assortment of sample chaos magic
        items, the better to give you an idea of the wide range
        of devices you can create.
        The second section is a listing of new mundane
        equipment and standard magic items. While a chaos
        mage cannot construct standard magic items, nor
        may he activate those items commonly associated
        with arcane spellcasters, there are still static magic
        items which he can benefit from, or which are
        thematically appropriate to the concept of chaos
        sorcery in general.
        Chaos Magic Items
        Magic items are an important element of the fantasy
        genre. Where would Arthur be without his Excalibur,
        or young Mister Potter without his wand? While it is
        actions that define a character and make them great,
        it is often his signature magical possessions which we
        remember, even years later.
        Magic items are even more important in fantasy
        gaming, and it the rare player indeed who does not
        enjoy collecting them for his characters as they
        advance in fame and ability. In a typical fantasy
        campaign, characters accumulate items in one of
        two ways, either by claiming them in exploration and
        blood soaked battle, or by crafting them.
        Enter the spellcaster. Where one finds spellcasters,
        one is bound to find magic items. Only spellcasters
        can craft the magic items that skilled heroes need to
        defeat the most dangerous of foes, and to accomplish
        the most daunting tasks. Wizards and sorcerers,
        with their ability to empower staves, wands, potions
        and weapons with strange and wondrous abilities,
        are well known as the premiere crafters of magical
        artefacts of all sorts.
        Until now.
        Chaos magicians can, like their arcane brethren,
        imbue ordinary items with extraordinary magical
        power. Unlike a wizard, however, who can fashion
        a dozen identical magical longswords, usable by any
        warrior able to attain them, the chaos mage can craft
        only one of a kind works of art, weapons uniquely
        attuned to but a single wielder, usually himself.
        Like chaos magic itself, there is a price to be paid
        when handling such objects of power. First, chaos-
        borne items lack the stability of more traditionally
        crafted items and their abilities tend to fluctuate over
        time. At first, the item will work perfectly, but over
        time, as the chaos energy which suffuses them begins
        to tug and snap its bonds, it will grow more unstable,
        eventually erupting in a burst of wild power.
        The second drawback is the strain that close proximity
        to restrained chaos can place on the wielder. In order
        to use a chaotic item, the wielder must be attuned to
        the object, melding his energies with its embedded
        power.
        Forging Chaos
        Creating items imbued with chaos power is a difficult
        process. Weak or inexperienced chaos mages are in
        danger of bodily harm at every turn, and they also risk
        spoiling thousands of gold pieces worth of expensive
        materials should they fail to successfully harness the
        chaos energy.
        102
        TOOLS OF THE TRADE
        Chaos mages are free of many of the restrictions
        which affect their traditional counterparts, which is
        only fair, as they face a series of difficult steps each
        time they wish to infuse an object with chaos energy. Once a step is started, it must be completed, but
        the mage can abandon the process between steps if
        desired, ruining the item.
        Rules Summary
        The rules for creating chaos magic item are
        summarised below, to allow you to familiarise
        yourself with the principles behind the design system
        before plunging in to start creating items.
        Chaos magic items are extremely flexible. By
        following the steps below, a player can fine tune and
        customise the magic items his character creates, to
        allow for the creation of nearly any item he might
        imagine. The steps must be followed in order, and
        each step must be completed before the next can
        begin.
        1) Select Infusion
        All chaos magic items bestow a benefit to the
        character who wields them. The infusion(s) selected
        determines precisely what the benefit is.
        2) Gather Materials
        Potent energies are involved with the infusing of
        mundane objects with the raw power of chaos
        sorcery, so any vessel intended for use must be of the
        highest quality. In this step, you will gather all the
        materials necessary.
        3) Create Tempering Solution
        Every chaos mage has their own formula for the
        tempering solution required to prepare an object for
        infusion with chaos energy. In this step, you will
        create this expensive solution.
        4) Temper Item
        The solution is applied to the object, in order to
        prepare it to receive the force of wild sorcery.
        5) Complete Infusion
        In this, the final step of the process, the item is
        impregnated with chaos energy. If all the previous
        steps have been followed faithfully, the mage is now
        in possession of a potent chaos magic item.
        Step 1 – Select
        Infusion
        In order to create chaos magic items, the mage must
        infuse it with the raw force of primal chaos. Though
        there are many different varieties of chaos infusions,
        all infusions contained within the same magic item
        must be of the same type. Chaos magic is difficult
        enough to force into any static form, so attempts to
        create exotic infusion mixtures must inevitably fail. The following list of infusion types should allow you
        to create magic items of almost any type.
        Augmentation
        Augmentation infusions are the most common
        type, as they are the most immediately useful to
        adventurers. An augmentation infusion adds an
        enhancement bonus to any one of the following:
        † Damage rolls
        † Attack rolls
        † Armour Class
        † Ability Score
        Each augmentation infusion can only affect a single
        one of the above. Multiple augmentation infusions
        can be contained within the same item, but each must
        have a different effect.
        All augmented weapons are considered magical for
        the purposes of piercing damage reduction.
        Insight
        An insight infusion provides a bonus to a single
        skill. The skill which will receive the bonus must
        be specified at the time of creation and cannot be
        changed later.
        Resistance
        A resistance infusion directly applies to a character’s
        saving throws, enabling them to resist specific attacks
        more easily. This type of item grants an enhancement
        bonus to either Reflex, Fortitude or Will saves.
        Storage
        A storage infusion hods a bit of raw, primal chaos for
        later use by the chaos mage. Having the energy to tap
        allows the mage to cast more powerful spells than he
        would normally be capable of, while decreasing the
        chances he will suffer a backlash.
        103
        TOOLS OF THE TRADE
        Maximum Bonuses
        Augmentation and Resistance bonus items are
        able to provide a maximum bonus of +1 for
        every 4 caster levels their creators possess.
        Insight bonus items are able to provide a
        maximum bonus of +1 per 2 caster levels. There
        is no effective upper limit to luck and storage
        items.
        The Weight of History
        As objects age, they solidify their place in
        reality, becoming ever more anchored into
        existence. Such items are not easily destroyed,
        not even by the intrusion of chaos sorcery. Truly
        ancient items, those over 500 years old, are so
        jealous of their form and so ingrained in reality
        that they are considered masterwork for the
        purposes of holding chaos energy, even if they
        appear to be rotting, scuffed and battered.
        Only those objects which have remained
        (mostly) whole throughout their long existence
        are suitable for use in this fashion, meaning
        the shattered remnants of an ancient sceptre
        are not suitable for use with chaos infusions.
        Alternately, the Games Master might rule that an
        ancient item which is repaired by a craftsman of
        legendary skill can be used to store chaos energy. Any chaos mage attuned to an item with this type of
        infusion can use the energy it contains to lower the
        final casting DC of any casting check made while
        casting a chaos magic spell. A chaos mage can draw
        up to three points of chaos energy per caster level
        from a storage infusion for use during the casting
        of a spell, with each point adding a +1 enhancement
        bonus to the casting check required to cast the spell. Once the stored magic is used, it is not automatically
        replenished.
        Luck
        A luck infusion attempts to bend the forces of chaos
        in favour of the character wielding, by clustering the
        object with positive outcomes, or possibilities, while
        forcing more negative possibilities onto other beings. For every point of luck placed into an object, the
        wielder can add +1 to any die roll once each day. Up
        to three points of luck can be used towards any one
        die roll, providing a maximum circumstance bonus of
        +3. Each time the character uses luck, however, the
        Games Master will give the character a -1 per point
        of luck used circumstance penalty to any one roll the
        character makes within the next day.
        Alternately, the Games Master can express the
        character’s bad luck in another fashion – perhaps the
        character’s wineskin springs a leak, or he drops his
        most prized possession into the mud, or a careless
        villager empties a piss-pot on his head.
        Step 2 – Gather
        Materials
        Once the chaos mage has decided exactly what
        elements will be included in his magic item, he
        must gather all the materials. Collecting the precise
        mixture of materials can be a challenging, time
        consuming task, requiring an attention to detail and
        an eye for quality ingredients. This is as it should be;
        chaos energy resists confinement with the ferocity of
        a wild dog; who is stupid enough to try leashing a
        wild dog with substandard gear?
        The first step in the process is selecting the base item. Only masterwork items are capable of being infused
        with chaos energy. Attempts to infuse lesser items
        results in an explosion of light and force, destroying
        the object and inflicting 3d8 points of damage to
        every character within 10 feet of the object. A Reflex
        save against DC 15 halves the damage suffered.
        Items once or currently enchanted with static magic
        effects are no longer capable of holding chaos
        infusions, and the reverse is true as well. The power
        of both chaos and static magic irrevocably and
        fundamentally alters the structure of the infused or
        enchanted object, rendering it useless for opposing
        sorcery.
        Step 3 – Create
        Tempering Solution
        Once an item has been selected to receive an infusion,
        the chaos mage must then brew the tempering
        solution which will actually bind the chaos energy to
        the item. This potent fluid will be massaged into the
        chosen item, to better prepare it for the wild influx of
        possibility energy it will soon receive.
        There is no one true recipe for creating tempering
        solution and the ingredients each chaos mage chooses
        say much about who he is, and what his relationship
        104
        TOOLS OF THE TRADE
        to primal chaos is. Ingredients are chosen by instinct
        and only the most self aware of chaos mages have
        even an inkling as to why they are driven to harvest
        the specific ingredients they use each time.
        The one common element to all tempering solutions
        is their reliance on rare and expensive components. Common wisdom among experienced chaos mages
        is that the more value mortals place on an object,
        the greater the flow of energy released when the
        item is broken down into its component elements. Gemstones, fragrant oils, rare herbs and the body
        parts of rare and wondrous creatures are the most
        common reagents used in the creation of tempering
        solutions, but blood, powdered metals and almost
        anything else can find its way into the mix.
        The cost for the tempering solution is based on the
        infusion the mage wishes to embed within the object,
        as outlined below:
        † Augmentation infusions require 500 gold pieces per
        point of enhancement, up to a total of 2,500 gold
        pieces for a +5 enhancement bonus.
        † Insight infusions require a tempering solution equal
        in value to 125 gold pieces per point of bonus, to
        a maximum of 1,250 gold pieces for a +10 insight
        bonus.
        † Resistance infusions cost 250 gold pieces per point
        of bonus, to a maximum cost of 1,250 gold pieces
        for a + 5 resistance bonus.
        † Luck bonuses require 100 gold pieces per point of
        luck to be embedded in the device, with no total
        limit to the amount which can be placed within.
        † Each point of stored chaos energy placed within an
        object requires 50 gold pieces worth of tempering
        solution, with no upper limit.
        Once the chaos mage has assembled all the necessary
        ingredients, he must spend 1 day per 500 gold piece
        value of reagents brewing the solution. This requires
        a steady heat source, such as a fireplace or lava pit,
        and a cauldron, but no other special equipment is
        needed.
        The ingredients are brewed together in the cauldron
        for the duration and each day the chaos mage must
        spend at least 8 hours actively working on the
        infusion, though he is allowed to take short breaks. He cannot take a day off, however, as once started,
        the process must continue through to completion. Should the caster be disturbed during his work time,
        or dedicate less time than he should to creating the
        infusion, it is spoiled and all the ingredients are
        wasted.
        Once the required amount of time has been spent
        working on the infusion, the chaos mage must
        succeed at a Craft (alchemy) skill check at DC 10 +
        1 per 500 gold piece value of the ingredients used. If
        successful, the tempering solution works as planned. If not, the tempering solution is useless, and all the
        ingredients wasted.
        Tempering solutions retain their effectiveness
        indefinitely – that said, each tempering solution is
        unique, and may only be used to on the item it was
        intended to protect. Should a solution be used on an
        item other than the intended one, it is wasted.
        Step 4 – Temper Item
        With both the object and the tempering solution
        prepared, the chaos mage is ready to begin the
        infusion. This is the most important part of the
        process, as failure in this step will cost the chaos
        mage both the object to be enchanted, and the
        tempering solution.
        Tempering the item requires one day per 1,000 gold
        pieces value of the combined cost of the tempering
        solution and the base object. During this time, the
        105
        TOOLS OF THE TRADE
        Properties of Chaos Magic Items
        Chaos magic items radiate a magical aura
        exactly as more traditional magic items do, but
        will only provide their benefits to a wielder who
        has been attuned to them, and only if he keeps
        them on his person.
        In other circumstances, chaos magic items are
        treated exactly as their static magic counterparts.
        They cease work in antimagic fields, and can be
        dispelled by dispel magic or other, similar spells.
        A chaos magic item which is dispelled has its
        powers temporarily suppressed as normal, and
        will return to full ability when the dispel magic
        effect ends.
        Drained Items
        When an item is drained of its last bit of stored
        chaos energy – as luck and stored energy
        items inevitably will be – it immediately loses
        two points of permanent hardness. The item,
        however, remains tempered, and can be re-
        infused with the same effect again.
        Sundered Items
        Chaos infused items can be sundered as other
        magic items can, to both the mage’s and the
        aggressor’s sorrow. Upon sundering, the item
        explodes, inflicting 3d8 points of damage to both
        the chaos mage and the one who sundered the
        item (if it was sundered with a melee attack). A
        Fortitude save against DC 15 reduces the damage
        to half.
        chaos mage must dedicate a minimum of 8 hours
        each day massaging the solution into the object. He
        can take breads during this time, but must spend the
        required time, lest the tempering solution and object
        merge too completely, destroying each other. The
        chaos mage must also receive a full day’s rest each
        day of the tempering, to restore his internal energies
        to the level where he can successfully regulate
        the flow of chaos force which is released by the
        tempering.
        After the required amount of time has elapsed,
        the chaos mage must succeed at a Craft (alchemy)
        skill check against a DC of 10 + 1 per 1,000 gold
        pieces, or part thereof, of the combined cost of the
        tempering solution and base item. Failure results
        in the destruction of the object and the loss of the
        tempering solution. The chaos mage has misjudged
        the ingredients and the solution corrodes the object
        rather than enhancing it. Within hours, after the last
        of the solution is absorbed, the object will first be
        rendered down into its component elements, then
        consumed in a flash of light.
        If the chaos mage succeeds at his craft check, however,
        the tempering solution visibly changes the item to be
        enchanted. Motes of primal chaos swirl beneath its
        surface, and light begins to refract in strange patterns
        when it strikes the object. Metal becomes slightly
        translucent, and wood, cloth and leather shine with
        vigour. The item is now ready for the final step of the
        infusion process.
        Step 5 – Complete
        Infusion
        Preparation complete, the chaos mage can now
        begin the last stage of the infusion process, opening
        himself up to the flow of primal chaos and directing it
        through his body and into the tempered object. This
        gruelling process requires hours of torturous effort,
        during which time the chaos mage must maintain
        his concentration and pray that his body endures the
        strain, as it is a very real danger at this stage that he
        will lose control and suffer immense damage as chaos
        splits his body like overripe fruit.
        This stage of the process requires 1 hour per 1,000
        gold pieces value of the item and tempering solution
        combined. The process requires a quite place, calm
        and free of distractions, and the chaos mage must
        remain undisturbed during the entire time – if he is
        interrupted for any reason, the infusion process is
        interrupted and the item is destroyed. The resulting
        burst of chaos energy inflict 1d8 points of damage per
        hour remaining in the process, with a Fortitude save
        reducing the damage by half.
        At the end of the required time, the chaos mage must
        make a successful Will save against a DC equal to
        10 + 1 per hour after the first, to successfully divest
        himself of the chaos energy which suffuses him. Should he fail, he suffers 1d8 points of lethal damage
        per hour of the ceremony (no save allowed), though
        the item is not destroyed.
        Once this final step is completed, the item has been
        properly infused, and is now ready to be attuned to
        the wielder.
        106
        TOOLS OF THE TRADE
        Attunement
        Once an object is made, it must be attuned. In most
        cases, only the chaos mage who created the item may
        attune himself to it, though other characters may
        attempt to attune themselves, at a much higher cost.
        To attune, the chaos mage must spend a full day with
        the item in an isolated location, during which time
        he must weaves flows of power between the item
        and himself, metaphorically stitching and binding
        his essence to the item’s. The process cannot fail,
        but when it is completed, the mage is left slightly
        weakened, since a portion of his personal energy is
        now tied up in the item.
        For each infusion the character has attuned to
        himself, he suffers a -1 penalty to either his Strength,
        Dexterity or Constitution. It is not possible to suffer a
        reduction to an ability score which is directly affected
        by the item (so a ring which increases the mage’s
        Strength cannot simultaneously reduce it), or one
        which is directly tied into an affected skill (meaning
        an amulet which provides a bonus to Tumble checks
        cannot reduce Dexterity). This reduction in ability
        scores is not permanent, but can only be healed once
        the item is destroyed, or if the chaos mage removes
        his attunement to the item.
        Characters other than the chaos mage who created the
        item may attempt to attune themselves to an object,
        so long as they are willing to pay the penalty. To
        attune, they must spend a day with the object in quiet
        isolation, then succeed at a Will save against a DC
        equal to 10 + 1 per 1,000 gold pieces value of the
        item (base cost + tempering solution). Other chaos
        mages may reduce the DC of this Will save by their
        Wisdom modifier. Should they succeed they are
        attune themselves successfully, but must temporarily
        sacrifice 1 point from any two of the following ability
        scores: Strength, Dexterity and Constitution. Those
        who fail suffer 1 point of temporary damage to all
        three ability scores and also suffer 3d8 points of
        damage (no save allowed), as chaos energy surges
        through their body. Neither the ability score or hit
        point damage can be healed by the use of magic, so
        only long periods of rest will return the victim to his
        fully healed state.
        Chaotic
        Decay
        Items enchanted with chaos
        power are under constant attack
        by the energies they contain. Chaos resists imprisonment,
        as static form is antithetical to
        endless possibility and so any
        object which contains it begins
        to deteriorate as soon as it is
        infused.
        An item’s hardness score
        determines how long it can
        contain the chaos which boils
        inside it. More important
        than the hardness of the item,
        however, is the strength of the
        user’s will. Those with great
        willpower can prolong the life
        of their magic items almost
        indefinitely, holding the flux of
        chaos in check with raw desire.
        When an object is attuned, the
        wielder must succeed at a Will
        save each week (at the DC shown

        ‘Where is he then?’ asked Aesip, a resigned frown doing nothing to improve an already ugly face.
        ‘He’s, erm, under arrest,’ replied Chatsworth, who was trying his best to overcome the increasing embarrassment
        that was his brother, Bartleby.
        ‘He’s what?’ howled Serge, barely able to control his temper. It had been the third night in a row that the gnome had
        failed to remain in their lodgings, despite promises to the contrary.
        ‘What exactly happened?’ demanded Aesip, suddenly intrigued. Something told the thief that there was a fine story
        in here somewhere.
        ‘Hard to know where to begin,’ said Chatsworth. He paused, thought deeply, and came to a decision. It was no use;
        they would have to be told. ‘You remember he has been spending a lot of time perfecting a new magic item?’
        ‘More of that thrice-damned chaos magic, no doubt,’ grunted Serge.
        ‘Well, quite,’ agreed Chatsworth weakly. ‘It turns out that the item he has been so secretive about was, well, how can
        I put it? An… appendage.’
        ‘A what?’ the others yelled in unison.
        ‘An appendage… a bodily attachment. It appears linked to this recent change in personality.’
        ‘You mean the one that makes him think he’s a riverfront tart?’ observed Aesip.
        ‘Yes, that would be it,’ agreed Chatsworth, as perplexed as the others. ‘Anyway, equipped with this magical, erm,
        accessory, Bartleby went down to the Seamen’s district last night looking, I imagine, for a spot of romance.’
        This drew snorts of knowing disgust.
        He continued: ‘It appears that he has been making rather too much personal use of this item lately and it, well, it
        sort of went off.’
        ‘How bad can that be?’ asked Aesip, grinning widely now at the thought of Bartleby’s discomfort.
        ‘The problem arises from the fact that the item was, how can I put it, in use at the time. He’s up on charges of murder
        and possessing a demonic weapon.’
        It took the others some time to stop laughing. ‘One thing’s for sure,’ said Serge. ‘This is going to be one hell of a
        court case.’
        on the table below), or the object permanently loses
        1 point of hardness. There is no way to repair this
        loss, as the ravenous appetite of chaos literally eats
        away the item, freeing its essence to once again rage
        beyond the veil of reality.
        Objects which are not attuned suffer an accelerated
        rate of decay, losing a point of hardness every 3 days,
        with no possibility of halting the process short of
        attunement.
        Regardless of whether the item has an attuned wielder
        or not, the corrosive affects of chaos quickly become
        obvious to those who care to look. The item becomes
        weak and brittle looking, filled with hairline fractures
        and even flickering from view on occasion.
        Explosive Decay
        When the last point of an item’s hardness is destroyed,
        the object erupts in a brilliant explosion of escaping
        energy, raw chaos venting its fury at everything in its
        path.
        When an item succumbs, the character attuned to
        the item must immediately make a Fortitude save
        against a DC of 15, as the chaotic bonds between
        the item and himself suddenly explode with liberated
        energy. If he succeeds, he suffers only half damage,
        but otherwise suffers the full brunt of the blast. 1d12
        damage is inflicted for every +1 enhancement, insight,
        resistance or luck bonus the item was enchanted with,
        or for every 5 points of stored energy it contained. In
        addition, the item explodes, filling a 10 feet radius
        with shards of debris and burning energy. All within
        range of the explosion suffer 3d6 points of damage,

        Options, and More Options
        Maximum Number of Attunements – Normally,
        the only limit to the number of attuned items the
        character possesses is his physical ability scores,
        or more precisely, the amount he is willing to
        sacrifice from his ability scores to maintain his
        items. Instead, the Games Master might wish
        to impose a maximum number of attuned items
        equal to the wielder’s Wisdom bonus. This will
        limit the total number of items the character may
        possess, and make multi-infused items more
        common.
        Permanent Items – Using this option allows the
        chaos mage to create permanent magical items, at
        great personal cost to himself. By permanently,
        rather than temporarily sacrificing an ability
        score point to the item, the chaos mage makes it
        permanent. While the item can still be destroyed,
        it will never fall prey to explosive decay.
        A permanent item cannot later be infused with
        another effect, unless the character permanently
        sacrifices an ability score point as before. Those
        permanent items which contain bonuses which are
        by their nature temporary, such as luck bonuses,
        do not lose 2 points of hardness when their supply
        is exhausted. They can be refilled as normal,
        and the character does not have to sacrifice an
        addition ability score point to re-attune himself
        to the item.
        with a Reflex save (DC 15) allowed to take half
        damage.
        Multiple Infusions
        It is possible to infuse an item with more than one
        bonus, but subsequent infusions accelerate the
        chaotic decay.
        If an item is already infused, it still must be tempered
        as before to add another infusion. The cost and
        difficulty are calculated exactly as before, until the
        chaos mage reaches the final stage of the process. At
        that point, the will save DC is increased by 5 for every
        infusion after the first. Failure to successfully infuse
        the item results in its destruction as normal, with the
        caster suffering additional damage from the original
        infusion(s) as though the item were destroyed by
        explosive decay.
        If an item is successfully infused with another effect,
        the caster need not re-attune himself to the object,
        though he must still dedicate another point of ability
        score, as detailed in the attunement section.
        When an object which contains multiple infusions
        suffers explosive decay, the total dice of damage
        inflicted is multiplied by the total number of separate
        infusions. The risks of heavily infusing an object may
        not be readily apparent, but make quite an impression
        when the item detonates your favourite tower.
        Sample Chaos Magic
        Items
        What follows is an eclectic mix of infused magic
        items, to give you an idea of the sorts of effects you
        can achieve with the chaos magic item system.
        You will note that chaos magic items are not really
        intended to replicate traditional magic items, nor
        would they be particularly effective at doing so. Chaos items are intended to bolster the wielder’s
        prowess, or provide him with much needed stores of
        energy. They are not intended to allow him to fly, or
        turn invisible, or create unbreakable bands of iron, or
        summon elementals from a smoking bowl. That said,
        you will notice that chaos items can still be used in
        a variety of ways, to create flavourful items which fit
        well in the fantasy milieu.
        Rabbit’s Foot
        The rabbit’s foot is a simple folk enchantment, which
        provides the attuned character with several powerful
        bonuses. While the item is not hardy, meaning it can
        easily fall prey to explosive decay, it is still eminently
        useful.
        The rabbit’s foot provides a +2 resistance bonus to
        Reflex saves, a + 5 insight bonus to Spot skill checks
        and 10 points of floating luck, the better to allow
        him to recognise dangerous situations and react
        appropriately to them.
        Cost: 51 (masterwork rabbit’s foot) + 500 gp
        (resistance) + 625 (insight) + 1,000 gp (luck). Hardness 2.

        Storage 10 + 1 per 5 points of stored energy (or portion thereof)
        Luck 10 + 1 per point of stored luck
        itself in its path. The Razor contains two infusions,
        an augmentation infusion, and a luck infusion. The
        augmentation infusion grants the dagger a +5 to attack
        rolls, while the luck infusion provides 10 points of
        floating luck which can be used to further augment
        the wielder’s strikes when he needs them most.
        Typically, a weapon such as the razor will be attuned
        to the wielder’s Constitution, as a reduction in either
        Strength or Dexterity could seriously limit the
        weapon’s effectiveness.
        Cost: 2,500 gp (augmentation) + 1,000 gp (luck) +
        302 (masterwork dagger) + 2 points temporary ability
        score loss.
        Ring of Thuggery
        The ring of thuggery is an innocuous crude iron
        bauble which grants a
        powerful bonus to those
        mages who prefer to attack
        with their bare hands. The
        ring grants a +2 augmentation
        bonus to damage, but only in
        regards to unarmed attacks
        and a +4 insight bonus to
        Intimidate checks.
        Cost: 200 gp (ring) + 1,000
        gp (augmentation) + 600 gp
        (insight).
        Skullcap of
        Unmatched Mastery
        This skullcap offers the chaos
        mage both a crucial bonus to
        his Wisdom score, and a deep
        well of stored chaos energy to
        draw from. The mage who
        wears it (in this case) gains a
        +2 bonus to his Wisdom, and
        has 20 points of stored chaos
        energy to draw from. This means he will successfully
        cast even the most difficult enchantments with ease,
        at least a few times.
        Typically, the skullcap of unmatched mastery is
        attuned using a point of the caster’s Strength, as a
        chaos mage who can so easily cast his spells has little
        need of physical power.
        Cost: 51 gp (masterwork skullcap) + 1,000 gp
        (augmentation) + 1,000 gp (stored energy). Hardness
        2.
        Spectacles of Insight
        Spectacles of insight are glasses especially enchanted
        to better allow the chaos mage to understand the
        ways and whims of human behaviour. When the
        caster dons the glasses, he takes note of subtle visual
        110
        TOOLS OF THE TRADE
        cues which reveal to him the true thoughts of those he
        looks upon. The glasses grant a maximum +10 bonus
        to all Sense Motive skill checks.

        spectacles). Hardness 2.
        Staff of Exquisite Magery
        The staff of exquisite magery is a relic of olden days,
        and all that remains of a powerful elven chaos mage
        lost to the mad ether millennia ago. Unlike most
        chaos items, this one is permanent, its creator having
        permanently sacrificed a portion of his essence to
        forever trap the chaos energy it holds.
        The staff provides a +5 enhancement bonus to
        Wisdom, a +5 enhancement bonus to Armour Class,
        a +10 insight bonus to Concentration checks and
        contains 50 points of
        stored chaos energy. It
        is among the most
        powerful chaos

        c o s t
        to the
        w i e l d e r
        equivalent to the power it grants. Due to the nature
        of permanent enchantments, the attuned owner must
        sacrifice 4 points of his ability scores to forever fuse
        his essence to the staff’s. Most who find the staff
        consider that a small price to pay.
        Cost: 300 gp (masterwork quarterstaff) + 2,500
        gp (Wisdom augmentation) + 2,500 gp (AC
        augmentation) + 1,250 (insight) + 2,500 (stored
        energy) + 4 points permanent ability score loss.
        New Equipment
        While chaos mages can, in most cases, use their
        mastery of chaos sorcery to create tools, that is not
        always the wisest course. Sometimes, it is better for
        a character to simply carry the tools he needs, so he
        need not rely on the vagaries of chaos energy.
        The following items of equipment, while in most
        cases usable by anyone, may prove to be of special
        interest to chaos mages of all sorts.
        New Weapons and Armour
        Chaos mages have little use for traditional weapons
        and armour, lacking both the training and the
        inclination to wield or wear them. That said, there
        are some decidedly non-traditional items which they
        favour.
        Weirdstone
        Weirdstone weapons are those which
        have either been embedded with flecks
        of metal taken from destroyed chaos
        magic items. Weirdstone weapons are
        relatively rare, as might be expected, but are
        not innately magical.
        Chaos energy is drawn to weirdstone like a moth
        to a flame, meaning weirdstone weapons are very
        effective as targets of chaos effects. A character
        successfully struck and damaged in combat by a
        weirdstone dagger suffers a -1 penalty to all
        saves to resist chaos magic effects for
        three rounds.
        A single lump of weirdstone is sufficient
        to create a single dagger, or ten
        arrowheads. Two lumps of weirdstone
        can create a Medium-sized weapon, and
        111
        TOOLS OF THE TRADE
        three lumps of weirdstone are required to sufficiently
        impregnate a Large weapon.
        Weirdstone: 150 gp per lump.
        Thickened Cloth
        Robes and cloaks made from thickened cloth are
        useful for reducing the trauma inflicted by injuries
        in combat. The cloth, which is thick and heavy as
        canvas, is difficult to weave, and rather ugly, but can
        be a literal life saver.
        Thickened cloth reduces the shock trauma inflicted
        by bludgeoning weapons by 4 points and slashing
        weapons by 2 points, but only for the purposes
        of determining whether the mage must make
        a Concentration check. The character suffers
        the damage as normal, but need only make a
        Concentration check if the attack inflicts more
        damage than the thick cloth can absorb.
        For example: While casting a spell, a chaos mage is
        struck in combat by a goblin wielding a war hammer. The attacks inflicts only 3 points of damage. The
        mage suffers the 3 points of damage as normal, but the
        thick cloth absorbs the shock of the blow completely,
        meaning the mage need not roll a Concentration
        check to maintain the spell. If the attack had inflicted
        5 or more points of damage, however, the chaos mage
        would need to attempt a check as normal.
        Thickened cloth: +50 gp to the base cost, and +10
        lbs. to the based cost of the cloak or robe.
        New Equipment
        Chaos mages do not rely on equipment, but it does
        make their lives easier. In addition to the normal
        roster of wineskins, map cases, backpacks, rope and
        torches that all adventurers carry, and the alchemical
        gear and specialised research materials most sorcerers
        and wizards own, chaos mages frequently pack the
        following items wherever they go.
        Grog of Giddy Wonder
        This strange alchemical compound is a strong
        hallucinogen in the form of a potent alcohol. Typically bright green in colour, it is made from a
        precise mixture of ingredients which are normally
        quite toxic. Chief among these ingredients is
        wyrmwood sap, a viscous fluid taken from the tree
        of the same name – the tree grows only near fairy
        mounds and can be difficult to harvest.
        When consumed, Grog of Giddy Wonder grants
        the imbiber a +4 bonus to all chaos sorcery casting
        checks, as he can literally see the flow of chaos in the
        ether. The positive effects last for 1 hour.
        On the downside, the imbiber also suffers a -4 penalty
        to all Will saves versus mind-affecting spells or spell
        like effects and against illusions of all sorts. Since
        the drinker is already drifting in a haze of imaginary
        sights and sounds, he is predisposed to believe
        everything he sees and hears. The negative effects
        of the grog last for the duration of the good effects (1
        hour) plus a further hour.
        When the imbiber comes down from his high, he is
        temporarily sickened by the toxicity of the drink. He
        suffers 2 points of temporary Constitution damage,
        which is healed as normal.
        Grog of Giddy Wonder: 100 gp per dose.
        Salve of Corruption’s Ease
        The roots of a chaos mage’s powers are dark and
        terrible and none who touch it can stay pure, or at
        least unchanged, for long. Salve of Corruption’s
        Ease is a powerful tonic which helps prevent a chaos
        mage from falling further along the Paths of Chaos
        (see the Paths of Chaos chapter for details).
        A single application of the salve reduces the chance
        of taking a further step along a Path of Chaos as a
        result of a backlash by 1, to a minimum of 1.
        For example: a chaos mage who has taken 4 steps
        along a Path of Chaos rolls a backlash. Normally, on
        a roll of 4 or less on a d20, he would then move to the
        fifth step of his path. If he is protected by Salve of
        Corruption’s Ease, however, he only takes a fifth step
        on a roll of 3 or less.
        A single application of salve is sufficient to protect a
        chaos mage for 1 full day, or until after he must roll
        for his first chaos backlash (whichever comes first).
        Salve of Corruption’s Ease: 500 gp per dose.

        New Wondrous Items
        Chaos mages prefer their own magic and magic items,
        to those created by traditional static magic. Still,
        they are not adverse to using those wondrous objects
        which can enhance their prowess as adventurers, or
        simply enhance their way of life.
        The following objects do one, or the other, or both.
        Cloak of the Forever Traveller
        The cloak of the forever traveller is a sturdy, well
        made, but plain looking traveller’s cloak, the kind of
        clothing seen on peasants and pilgrims along every
        road. The cloak appears to be made of course, grey
        wool, but is in reality made of a magical fabric woven
        from the raw essence of matter itself – in that respect,
        it is akin to chaos magic.
        The powers of the cloak are such that it instantly
        adapts itself to any environment the traveller finds
        himself in, becoming a heavy fur cloak in the winter
        wastes and a silky thin robe in the summer fields. The cloak of the forever traveller is considered to
        be appropriate garb for any environment, negating
        the dangers of exposure and other environmental
        damage.
        The cloak does not protect against the dangers of
        drowning, but is otherwise no burden to those who
        swim while wearing it.
        Cloak of the Forever Traveller: Caster level 10th;
        Craft Wondrous Item, find the path, protection from
        energy; price: 10,000 gp.
        Stone of Remembrance
        Stones of remembrance are powerful crystals, in
        a rainbow of colours, which are able to preserve
        the essence of the one who bears them, preventing
        them from the ravages of dark magic and the more
        unpleasant side effects of resurrection and similar
        magics. It also has the unintended side effect of
        protecting chaos mages from the ravages of their
        failed spell casting.
        When first grasped, the stone takes a quick
        ‘snapshot’ of the character, stealing a tiny bit
        of his essence and preserving it. Should the
        character be slain and later resurrected, the
        power of the stone activates, returning the
        stolen essence to its owner. This has the effect
        of negating level or Constitution loss from
        raise dead and other, similar spells.
        Chaos mages have discovered that the stone’s
        peculiar magic also protects them from the
        ravages of chaos backlash. When a chaos
        mage fails a backlash check that would
        normally cause him to progress along the Path
        of Chaos, the stone activates, counteracting the
        transformative power of chaos with the portion
        of soul energy it protects.
        In any case, once the stone has been used
        once it loses its power, and cannot protect the
        character further.
        Stone of Remembrance: Caster level 12th;
        Craft Wondrous Item, magic jar, remove
        curse; price: 85,000 gp.

        TRICKS OF THE TRADE
        Tricks of the
        Trade
        Chaos mages are men and women of many
        talents. They had better be, as the ravages of
        chaos can quickly reduce them to the status
        of outsider, forcing them to do for themselves in
        almost all situations. With that in mind, this chapter
        introduces you to the many devious tricks and useful
        talents that the more clever chaos mages use to make
        their lives easier and the lives of their opponents more
        difficult.
        This chapter is broken down into two sections. The
        first presents new uses for all the chaos mage’s class
        skills, to better represent the specialised ways in
        which creative mages can use their knowledge. The
        second section presents a new, optional subsystem
        concerning Chaos Mage Duels which you may wish
        to use in your campaigns, to bring a new dimension
        to your gaming adventures.
        New Uses for Existing
        Skills
        Chaos mages do not share their wizard counterpart’s
        exposure to higher education and they tend to have
        a more specialised skill set. As such, they are forced
        to make do with what they have, using their skills in
        unexpected ways – ways which those who do not
        understand the nature of endless possibility could
        never imagine.
        The following new uses for existing skills are
        intended for use primarily by those of the chaos mage
        character class. While the Games Master is free
        to rule that these existing skill uses can be utilised
        by anyone, it is not recommended; these skills add
        flavour, mystery and a certain ‘how did he do that?’ air to the chaos mage. Not all the skills listed below
        are from the chaos mage’s class skills list, but all will
        prove useful to him. All have ‘rank prerequisite’ – only those with a certain amount of experience and
        training in the skill (possessing the stated number of
        ranks in it) can use its special applications.
        Appraise
        Use this skill to identify antiques, or to recognise
        forgeries or inexpensive baubles.
        Original Use: A successful check allows you to
        identify the proper worth of an object.
        Exact Age (Rank Prerequisite 2): The chaos
        mage‘s understanding of chaos as the living force of
        possibility allows him to identify exactly how long an
        object has resisted change, and therefore, one aspect
        of possibility. With a successful skill check against
        a DC of 15-20, depending on the object’s rarity, the
        chaos mage identifies the object’s exact age. Unlike
        other Appraise checks, the more rare the object,
        the easier it is to identify its age; common objects
        simply do not leave as obvious a hole in the fabric of
        possibility as unique objects do.
        On a failed check, the mage under or overestimates
        the object’s true age by 50 to 150 percent of its actual
        age. The Games Master rolls 2d6+3, multiplies the
        result by 10 percent, and then multiplies the object’s
        actual age by that value.
        Bluff
        You make the outright false seem not just plausible,
        but likely. Original Use: A successful Bluff check allows you to
        pass a falsehood of as truth, or to mislead an enemy in
        combat so as to catch him unawares.
        Gibberish (Rank Prerequisite 4): Chaos magic
        is strange and many who do not know better see
        its practitioners as gibbering madmen, lost souls
        who shriek and flail their hands and claim to have
        power over reality itself. A devious chaos mage can
        use this to his advantage, fooling ignorant enemies
        into believing him no threat. With a successful Bluff
        check, opposed by a Knowledge (arcana) check, you
        successfully pass your spellcasting off as harmless
        fakery. Caught unawares, enemies who you have
        fooled suffer a -2 penalty to their first save against
        your chaos magic, so long as you cast a spell upon
        them in the same round, or in the round immediately
        following.
        Using Gibberish is a standard action. This skill use
        will not work if your opponents have already seen
        you cast a spell in combat.
        114
        TRICKS OF THE TRADE
        Concentration
        You can focus your mind to ignore pain and other
        distractions.
        Original Use: A successful Concentration check
        allows you to maintain your composure when struck
        in combat, so as not to spoil a spell.
        Slow Weaving (Rank Prerequisite 5): Chaos mages
        can reduce the casting DCs of their most powerful
        spells by extending the amount of time required to
        cast them (see the Chaos Sorcery chapter for details).
        This can be dangerous to do in combat, as the mage
        must normally dedicate full round actions to doing
        so. With a successful Concentration check, however,
        the mage can use standard actions, instead of full
        round, when extending the casting time of his spells.
        To do so, he must succeed at a casting check against a
        DC equal to the original casting DC of the spell. If the
        check is failed, the spell is disrupted as if the casting
        failed. If the check is successful, however, the mage
        need only dedicate standard actions to the casting
        each round.
        Twist Touch Effect (Rank Prerequisite 8): A chaos
        mage can hold a spell weave with a range of Touch
        for a number of rounds equal to half his caster level,
        rounded down (to a minimum of 1). Through sheer
        force of will he can, if he so chooses, attempt to
        modify such spells so that their Range element is
        changed, allowing him to attack foes who would
        otherwise remain out of his reach.
        To modify his spell, he must succeed at a
        Concentration check as he ‘throws’ the spell against
        a DC equal to the original casting DC + twice the
        DC modifier of the new range. If the check succeeds,
        the spell is modified as the caster wishes and erupts
        immediately. If the check fails, the spell is disrupted
        and the caster suffers the appropriate negative
        effects.
        Craft (alchemy)
        You are trained in the art of alchemy.
        Original Use: You can practice your trade and make
        a decent living, able to create any alchemical product
        from vials of acid to tindersticks.
        Brew Grog of Giddy Wonder (Rank Prerequisite
        2): Brewing a dose of Grog of Giddy Wonder requires
        a successful Craft (alchemy) check against DC 25.
        The elixir requires 1 week’s time to mature after it is
        brewed and each day the brewer must maintain the
        balance of the mixture with a DC 15 Craft (alchemy)
        check. The accumulated ingredients cost 50 gp.
        Brew Salve of Corruption’s Ease (Rank
        Prerequisite 6): Brewing a dose of Salve of
        Corruption’s Ease requires a successful Craft
        (alchemy) check against DC 20. The accumulated
        ingredients cost 250 gp.
        Craft (general)
        You are trained in a craft, trade, or art, such as
        weaving, alchemy, or smithing.
        Original Use: You can practice your trade and make
        a decent living.
        Study Features (Rank Prerequisite 4): A successful
        Craft check against DC 20 allows you to study the
        features of any item with which you are familiar
        (meaning those items you could create with your
        particular Craft skill). This careful analysis grants
        you a +2 insight bonus to caster level checks for
        Transformation or Materialisation-based spell
        effects which create or transform energy or matter
        into the object you have memorised. So, for example,
        a character with Craft (weaponsmith) could, with a
        successful check, study a sword and later replicate it
        with a Materialisation effect, gaining a +2 bonus to
        cast the spell.
        Once a specific type of item has been memorised and
        the memory subsequently used in a casting attempt,
        a new Craft check is necessary to memorise the item
        once again. A total of one-half your ranks in the Craft
        skill in craft-related items may be memorised at any
        one time.
        Intimidate
        Use this skill to force a bully to turn tail and run, or to
        force information out of a source.
        Original Use: A successful chek allows you to cow
        others into obeying your commands.
        115
        TRICKS OF THE TRADE
        Primal Understanding (Rank Prerequisite 8): The
        true face of chaos transcends the limits of mortal fear.
        Beyond understanding, beyond reasoning, it stands
        as the ultimate expression of the uncaring fury of the
        cosmos. The chaos mage is the herald of this force and
        carries within him tendrils of its primal fury. A chaos
        mage, and only a chaos mage, can use Intimidate
        against non-intelligent beings and against those who
        are normally immune to fear. A chaos mage also
        suffers no penalty when making Intimidation checks
        against beings which are of a larger size category.
        Knowledge (arcana)
        The knowledge skill encompasses study of some
        body of lore, perhaps even a scientific discipline.
        Original Use: Use Knowledge (arcana) to remember
        facts about arcane brotherhoods, or about the abilities
        of legendary monsters.
        Fractured Insight (Rank Prerequisite 6): While
        chaos magic cannot be used to divine the future, chaos
        mages are able to recognise the web of possibility
        which surrounds all beings. Clever mages are able to
        puzzle out this web, follow its strands and recognise
        patterns which identify the most likely course of
        action any being will take. This ability works best in
        combat, as that is when the web of possibility is most
        active and most obvious.
        With a successful Knowledge (arcana) check against
        a DC equal to 10 + one-half the creature’s character
        level or total Hit Dice + its Wisdom modifier, you
        gain a +1 insight bonus to both Armour Class and
        attack rolls against that creature for the remainder of
        the combat.
        If you use this ability before combat begins, you
        gain a +2 insight bonus to Initiative as well, as you
        are able to predict your enemy’s intentions moments
        before he knows them himself.
        Profession
        You are trained in a livelihood or professional role,
        such as lumberjack, herbalist or the like.
        Original Use: You can practice your trade and make
        a decent living, which includes the knowledge of how
        to use the tools of your trade.
        Gather Tempering Materials (herbalist, trapper,
        miner) (Rank Prerequisite 2): You know where
        to find the best natural ingredients to use in your
        tempering solutions (see the Tools of the Trade
        chapter for details of tempering solutions). A
        successful Profession (herbalist, trapper or miner)
        check allows you to find high quality materials for
        low prices. Multiply the result of your skill check by
        your Wisdom bonus, then subtract this amount from
        the cost of your tempering solution. The tempering
        solution’s cost cannot be reduced by more than half
        in this fashion. It takes a full week’s worth of effort to
        use Profession in this fashion, though the time need
        not be consecutive.
        New Profession – Mad Prophet: The common man
        of the typical fantasy world views the mad with
        a mixture of abject fear and superstitious dread,
        assigning to the insane all manner of mystical powers
        and insights. The clever chaos mage can use this
        belief in the ‘wisdom of the mad’ to his advantage. Of
        course, since most chaos mages are more than a little
        touched by their exposure to primal chaos energy,
        there may be a bit of truth in the superstition.
        With a successful skill check, the chaos mage is able
        to convince those around him that he has insight
        into past, present and future events. He does this by
        unleashing a rambling discourse on the true shape of
        reality, on the inherent nature of man, and so on and
        so forth.
        The chaos mage is able to earn a comfortable living in
        this fashion, though he suffers socially for doing so.
        He earns an amount of gold equal to his skill check
        each week, but suffers a -1 circumstance penalty
        to all Non-Player Character reaction skill checks
        made in the same week in any area he practices his
        prophecy craft
        Synergy Bonus: Chaos mages with 5 or more ranks
        in Bluff gain a +2 synergy bonus when attempting to
        use Profession (mad prophet).
        Spellcraft
        Use this skill to identify spells as they are being cast.
        Original Use: A successful skill check allows you to
        identify a spell’s school, as well as other important
        properties.
        116
        TRICKS OF THE TRADE
        Defensive Understanding (Rank Prerequisite
        4): Chaos mages reject the idea of prepared spells
        entirely. They view arcane formulas and memorised
        recitations as crutches for the weak, the necessary
        tools of those who do not understand the truth of
        arcane magic as they do. Whether or not this conceit
        is true, chaos mages do have an advantage when
        dealing with their traditional counterparts.
        With a successful check against DC 20 + spell level,
        you may, after having been targeted by a spell that
        required you to attempt a saving throw, identify
        its base properties, and the particular quirks of the
        caster, allowing you to alter your personal energies
        to better resist further spell attacks. You gain a +1
        insight bonus to your saving throws against spells
        from the same caster, a bonus which lasts for the
        duration of the battle or encounter.
        Chaos Mage Duels
        Using chaos magic is a dangerous business. Not only
        are spell weaves capable of wreaking immense havoc,
        but the very act of tapping the primal possibility flow
        can twist the caster, melt his bones from his flesh,
        gnaw the sanity from his mind and utterly smash his
        soul flat.
        No one understands the risks inherent in what they
        do better than chaos mages themselves, so when two
        chaos mages meet to hammer out a dispute, or to
        test one another’s abilities, they are understandably
        reluctant to unleash the full extent of their powers. To
        prevent unnecessary death and equally unnecessary
        mutation and madness, chaos mages prefer to engage
        one another in informal chaos mage duels.
        In an informal mage duel, the two casters face off and
        then open themselves to the raw flow of chaos. They
        use their abilities to poke and prod at one another,
        testing the limits of one another’s skill, then in a blur
        of thrust, cut and parry, they attempt to prove their
        superiority.
        By no stretch of the imagination are chaos mage
        duels formal affairs, as chaos mages do not, as a rule,
        enjoy the imposition of rules or tradition. That said,
        the mechanics of a chaos mage duel are always the
        same, regardless of whether the mages are facing
        each other in the king’s court, or standing atop the
        waves in a storm-tossed sea.
        Step 1 – Entering the Duel
        In order for a chaos magic duel to occur at all, both
        participants must agree to it. This agreement need not
        be verbal, but both mages must stop, face one another
        (within visual range) and relax their subconscious
        arcane defences. For the duration of the duel, both
        mages remain aware of their surroundings and are
        considered to be casting as a full-round action – this
        means that both casters are vulnerable to disruption
        from outside forces.
        A successful Spellcraft check (DC 15) made as a free
        action, identifies that a chaos mage has entered the
        state necessary to conduct a chaos magic duel. If both
        participants enter the proper state, the duel begins on
        the following round and proceeds to Step 2.
        If only one mage has entered the duelling state, the
        other mage is free to act as he will and need not enter
        into the duel. Once the duel has begun, however, it
        must be carried through to its conclusion; if the duel
        is ended before the appropriate time (Step 3), both
        duellists are affected as though they had lost the duel
        (see Step 5, though neither are intimidated).
        Step 2 – Assessment
        Once the duel is entered, the two mages can then
        begin to test one another’s ability to control and
        weave chaos. In this initial step of the duel, the
        connection between the participants is limited, so
        they can attempt to misdirect one another, should
        they wish to do so. During this step, the duelling
        mages see the confrontation of their auras as two
        great hosts of multicoloured streamers, twisting,
        twining and darting around one another, probing for
        weakness, choking and coiling and crushing.
        This step of the duel lasts three rounds. Every
        round, each chaos mage performs the following two
        actions.
        Display Might – The duellist rolls a caster check,
        just as though he were casting a chaos spell, meaning
        he rolls 1d20 + caster level + Wisdom modifier.
        117
        TRICKS OF THE TRADE
        Throw the Veil – Simultaneously, the duellist may
        disguise his strength, the better to catch his opponent
        by surprise or hide his own weakness. He rolls a Bluff
        skill check, using his Wisdom modifier rather than his
        Charisma modifier in this case.
        The duellists then reveal one of the two results
        for each round. Regardless of which he action he
        chooses, the duellist’s aura flares up to monstrous
        size, in proportion to the total of the casting roll or
        Bluff check result. Though the spectacle is visible
        only to the two duellists, all within visual range of
        the duel feel a weird, creeping dread, as though they
        were exposed to something wholly beyond the scope
        of everyday reality.
        Keep track of your character’s totals from every roll
        in each round and mark them as Display Might and
        Throw the Veil as appropriate, as this information
        will become important later.
        After three full rounds, move on to Step 3.
        Step 3 – Commitment
        In this step, the duellist’s auras retreat, snapping and
        untwining until each lays coiled about its master.
        This temporary ceasing of hostility lasts 1 round. The
        player of each duellist adds up the total of Step 2’s
        three rounds, using the results they chose to display
        each round.
        At this time, each duellist then decides whether he
        wishes to continue to the next step, or withdraw from
        the duel – this works best if the player(s) and Games
        Master each write their decision on a piece of scrap
        paper, then reveal their decision simultaneously.
        Should both duellists choose to withdraw, the duel
        ends with no repercussions save roleplaying ones, for
        either participant.
        Should one duellist decide to withdraw and the other
        continue, then the withdrawing party is considered
        to have capitulated; he is considered to be affected
        as though by a successful use of the Intimidate skill.
        Non-Player Character chaos mages are considered

        Real total: 91 96
        Step 5
        The winner of the duel is Duellist 2
        Deadly Duels
        Should either duellist choose, he may attempt
        to enter into a deadly duel. This decision must
        be made before the duel is begun and the other
        would-be duellist is made instantly aware of
        the aggressive duellist’s intentions. Should
        both participants enter into the deadly duel,
        conduct each step as normal, with the following
        exceptions:
        Should a character withdraw from the duel in
        Step 3, he is not only intimidated as normal, but
        is stunned for one round and suffers 2 points of
        temporary Wisdom damage.
        Should the duel proceed to the final step, the
        loser is forced to immediately roll to see if he
        takes a step along a Path of Chaos, as though he
        had suffered a backlash. He is considered two
        steps further along his path for the purposes of
        the backlash roll, signifying the ease with which
        chaos infects the weak.
        If interrupted before the duel is brought to its
        natural conclusion, both duellists are affected as
        though they had lost the duel.
        to be shaken, and cowed to the point of being
        considered friendly (see the Intimidate class skill for
        full details). Player character duellists are considered
        shaken only.
        Should neither duellist choose to withdraw, proceed
        to Step 4.
        Step 4 – The Final Strike
        In this final step, both duellists unleash their chaos
        power in full, striking each other a thousand times
        in the space of a heartbeat. The winner absorbs his
        enemy’s attacks unharmed, while the loser is battered
        by an overwhelming torrent of possibility.
        Roll one final caster level check (1d20 + caster level
        + Wisdom bonus) – the character with the highest
        single roll during Step 2 gains a +2 morale bonus to
        his roll, as the strength of his superior display bolsters
        his courage. At the same time, each duellist substitutes
        his actual total from Display Power, replacing any the
        Throw the Veil results he displayed.
        Then add up the totals, with the duellist who achieves
        the highest result winning the duel.
        Step 5 – Consequences
        The winner of the duel gains nothing save the
        satisfaction of victory. The loser of the duel suffers 4
        points of temporary Wisdom damage and is exhausted.
        He is also considered to be intimidated, as described in
        Step 3.

        DESIGNER'S NOTES
        Designer’s
        Notes
        Whew! Glad that’s over.
        As a writer, it is never easy to follow in another
        writer’s footsteps, especially when you have been
        given the task of taking one of his most liked and
        respected works and updating, expanding and
        revising it. The biggest problem is that it is difficult
        to take a good work and make it objectively better
        – conversely, it is a simple as tripping over your own
        shoes to make it worse.
        No one wants to be known as the guy who made it
        worse.
        So, here I am, for once actually writing the
        designer’s notes after the entire book is actually
        written. Usually, I write these things, or at least a
        rough draft of them, right at the beginning – maybe
        its just like those novelists who write the end first,
        or perhaps it is just a bit of optimism, a way for me
        to say to myself ‘see, self, someday you will get
        this thing written, the designer’s notes say so right
        there’. In any case, I was emphatically not able to do
        that here.
        Here is the part where I confess that, when I got this
        assignment, I was at a complete loss for what to do.
        See, I had read the reviews of Encyclopedia
        Arcana: Chaos Magic, I had read the rules, I had
        seen the goods for myself. And the goods were
        good. Sam Witt’s work led the way in bringing
        free-form magic to the fantasy game we all know
        and love, and gamers knew it, embraced his book
        and demanded more. I have it on good authority
        that the Quintessential Chaos Mage has been one of
        Mongoose’s most heavily requested titles for a long
        time.
        So, here I am. The man who brought more.
        Looking back over the work I have done here, I
        can say that I am quite proud of it. Sam’s work is
        a great foundation, and I would like to think that
        I have taken that foundation and built something
        really nice on top of it. I am particularly proud of
        the work I did in clarifying and expanding the actual
        rules for chaos sorcery and with the sample spell
        weaves I put together. I think I have done my part
        to make the chaos magic rules more usable, and
        more importantly, more user friendly. In doing so,
        I think I have made the free-form magic rules more
        attractive and less daunting to those unfamiliar with
        them – hopefully, this means that more people will
        adopt Sam’s fantastic work into their own campaign.
        If that happens, I will be pleased as a writer can be.
        Thanks
        First and foremost, I have to thank Sam Witt. I
        will also take this time to curse him. His work was
        excellent, so excellent that it simultaneously made
        it easy for me to do write and completely nerve
        wracking to do my job. For that, I will thank him
        more than curse him. But only because, having
        finished the book, I can afford to be mellow.
        Thanks also to Mongoose, who gave me my first job
        in the industry and continue, despite advice to the
        contrary, to give me even more jobs. Guess I still
        have them fooled.
        And, finally, thanks as always to my wife and three
        beautiful children, the last of whom was born the
        day I started this book. Without my wife, I do not
        know how I would ever get these things done; her
        advice, her good humor and her even temper (that’s
        sarcasm folks) have kept me on task when I needed
        it most.

        Persistent Damage Effect
        Casting DC: 5
        Save: Fort half
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continued Concentration: Yes
        Persistent Damage effect causes a single 1d8

        1d8 on each subsequent round.
        Degrading Damage Effect
        Casting DC: 10
        Save: Fort half
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continued Concentration: Yes
        In the first round, the spell does one-half the
        caster’s chaos mage level in d8s of damage, one
        die less than that in the following round, then
        continues to drop by 1d8 per round after that
        until no more dice remain.

        force to fire, cold, electric, sonic or acid.
        Negligible Domination
        Casting DC: 5
        Save: Will negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continuous Concentration: No
        A Negligible Domination effect is a bit of
        mental sleight of hand, a soft nudge able to
        influence, but not control, a target.
        Minor Domination
        Casting DC: 10
        Save: Will Negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continuous Concentration: No
        Minor Domination effects are more insidious
        than Negligible effects and are capable of,
        albeit temporarily, seizing control of the
        victim’s mind.
        Major Domination
        Casting DC: 15
        Save: Will Negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continuous Concentration: See below
        A major effect can have lasting implications on
        the target.
        Extraordinary Domination
        Casting DC: 20
        Save: Will negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        A moderate Movement effect is sufficient to
        allow travel to a distance of 100 feet + 10 feet
        per caster level.
        Major Movement
        Casting DC: 20
        Save: Will Negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continued Concentration: No
        A major Movement effect is sufficient to allow
        affected beings to move 500 feet + 50 feet per
        caster level.
        Extreme Movement
        Casting DC: 25
        Save: Will Negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continued Concentration: No
        An extreme Movement effect is powerful
        enough to move recipients 1 mile + 1 mile per
        caster level.
        Universal Movement
        Casting DC: 30
        Save: Will Negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continued Concentration: No
        A universal effect is the most powerful of
        all Movement effects, sufficient to allow the
        chaos mage, or those he designates as targets,
        to pierce the veil between worlds and travel to
        other dimensions.
        Negligible Transformation
        Casting DC: 5
        Save: Will negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continued Concentration: No
        Negligible Transformation effects allow for
        nothing more than surface changes, or the most
        minor of benefits.
        Minor Transformation
        Casting DC: 10
        Save: Will Negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continued Concentration: No
        Minor Transformation effects are both powerful
        and dangerous, as substantial amounts of matter
        can be rearranged as the caster desires.
        Moderate Transformation
        Casting DC: 15
        Saves: Will negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continued Concentration: No
        Moderate Transformation effects are capable
        of rendering massive changes in the target,
        warping their form and their flesh as easily as a
        potter shapes clay.
        Total Transformation
        Casting DC: 20
        Save: Will negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continued Concentration: No
        A total Transformation effect is startling in its
        comprehensiveness and sheer power.
        Continuous Concentration: See below
        Extraordinary Domination effects are powerful
        enough to change the fate of nations.
        Negligible Materialisation
        Casting DC: 5
        Save: None
        Spell Resistance: No
        Continued Concentration: No
        A single item of up to an ounce of weight per
        caster level can be created from the primal matter
        of chaos.
        Minor Materialisation
        Casting DC: 10
        Save: None
        Spell Resistance: No
        Continued Concentration: No
        A single item, weighing no more than one pound
        per caster level, can be created from chaos
        matter.
        Moderate Materialisation
        Casting DC: 15
        Save: None
        Spell Resistance: No
        Continued Concentration: No
        At this level of effect, the chaos mage can create
        one or more items with a maximum combined
        weight of two pounds per level of the caster.
        Major Materialisation
        Casting DC: 20
        Save: None
        Spell Resistance: No
        Continued Concentration: No
        A major Materialisation effect is sufficient to
        create objects with a maximum combined weight
        of five pounds per caster level.
        Chaos Construct Materialisation
        Casting DC: 20 – 30
        Save: None
        Spell Resistance: No
        Continued Concentration: Yes
        A chaos mage can, if he chooses, create an
        animated creature of chaos, a being with
        rudimentary intelligence and the ability to follow
        its master’s orders. There are three classes of
        chaos construct, as shown on the Chaos Construct
        table.
        Minor Movement
        Casting DC: 10
        Save: Will Negates
        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continued Concentration: No
        A minor Movement effect is sufficient to allow
        the caster or an amount of weight equal to 10 x
        his caster level to move a maximum distance of
        20 feet + 5 feet per caster level.
        Moderate Movement

        Spell Resistance: Yes
        Continued Concentration: No
        The ultimate expression of the transformative
        power of chaos. At this level of effect, items
        are transformed into pure chaos energy and
        can be refashioned as the chaos mage wills. Weight can be increased by 10% per caster level,
        uniquely beneficial features can be added and
        the composition of the object can be changed in
        utterly unnatural ways.
        Combining Multiple Effects
        To determine the casting DC of a spell with more
        than one effect, first determine which effects have
        the lowest casting DC. Then, add one half of the
        lower DC (rounding up) to the casting DC of the
        most difficult effect, which gives you the total
        effect element DC. In cases where two separate
        effects have the same casting DC, simply select
        one of them for the reduced cost. The effects
        with the reduced cost are referred to as subsidiary
        effects.
        Step 2: Choose an Area of Effect
        Element
        All chaos magic spell effects have a designated
        area of effect, from effects that target only the
        caster or another individual, to spells which
        encompass wide swathes of terrain or hordes of
        beings.
        Single Target (DC +0)
        Two Targets (DC +3)
        Burst (DC +5)
        The minimum burst radius is 5 feet, and the
        maximum is equal to the caster level x 5 feet.
        Cone (DC +5)
        The minimum length of the cone is 10 feet, and
        the maximum is equal to caster level x 5 feet.
        Spread (DC +10)
        The minimum spread is 5 feet, and the maximum
        is equal to the caster’s level x 5 feet.
        Enemies Only Modifier (DC +5)
        Allies Only Modifier (DC +5)
        Chosen Modifier (DC +1 per subject)
        Objects Only Modifier (DC +0)
        Step 3: Choose a Range Element
        All chaos magic spells require a range element. While it is relatively simple for a chaos mage to
        use an effect against a target right in front of him,
        he does not have to. A skilled chaos mage can
        launch effects across a distance of miles.
        Touch or Self (DC +0)
        Close (DC +1)
        The maximum range of the spell is 25 feet + 5 feet
        per two caster levels.
        Medium (DC +5)
        The maximum range of the spell is 100 feet + 10
        feet per caster level.
        Long (DC +10)
        The maximum range of the spell is 400 feet + 40
        feet per caster level.
        Should a chaos mage so choose, he can reduce
        a spell’s casting check’s DC by increasing the
        time required to cast it. By increasing the
        casting time to a full round action, he reduces
        the casting check DC by 2. Every additional
        round, beyond the first, spent casting the spell
        decreases the casting check DC by 1, to a
        maximum reduction of –10.
        If the chaos mage is distracted while casting,
        his Concentration check DC is modified by
        the spell’s casting DC, rather than damage
        suffered. If he fails this check, he is also
        assumed to fail casting the spell.
        Common Triggers (DC -5)
        Uncommon Triggers (DC -10)
        Rare Triggers (DC -15)
        Very Rare Triggers (DC -20)
        Triggers and Spell Duration
        Should a caster wish to insure that his triggered
        spell last longer than that amount, he can add
        the following enhancement to the spell.
        Extend Dormancy (DC + 5)
        A spell effect which has extended dormancy
        will persist for one week per caster level, or
        until its trigger has been tripped.
        Triggers and the Limits of the Mortal Form
        A chaos mage can have only 1 dormant spell
        per 2 caster levels at any one time. A chaos
        mage can choose at any time to cancel a
        dormant effect, either to replace it with a new
        one, or to simply let it dissipate back into the
        ether.
        Concentration
        Spells with the continuous concentration
        requirement can only be maintained by force
        of will, lest they lose coherence and sputter
        away. Maintenance of a spell does not provoke
        an attack of opportunity, but is otherwise
        considered a standard action in every way. Anything which can disrupt a spell during
        its casting can also disrupt the concentration
        required to maintain it, requiring the chaos
        mage to attempt a Concentration check as
        per the rules in Core Rulebook I. When
        determining the DC of the check, use the
        casting DC of the chaos spell being maintained
        as the basic difficulty and add modifiers as
        necessary.
        The Limits of Mind and Body
        Each time a chaos mage casts a spell, he
        suffers one point of damage for each five full
        points in the spell’s casting DC. This damage
        is applied immediately after the casting check
        is attempted, regardless of whether it was
        successful or not. If the casting check is
        successful, the damage is nonlethal, but if it is
        failed, the damage suffered is real.
        Extreme (DC +15)
        The maximum range of the spell is 1 mile + 1
        mile per caster level.
        Step 4: Choose a Duration
        Element
        Instantaneous (DC +0)
        The effect is applied immediately and lasts
        but a split-second before evaporating.
        One Round (DC +2)
        The spell’s effects apply for a single round.
        By Round (DC +5)
        The spell’s duration is increased to one round
        per caster level.
        By Minute (DC +10)
        The spell has a duration of one minute per
        caster level.
        By Hour (DC +15)
        The spell has a duration of one hour per two
        caster levels.
        Secondary Duration Modifier (DC
        variable)
        A secondary Duration element costs half the
        increase to casting DC (rounded up), so that a
        secondary By Round duration would add 3 to
        the casting DC, rather than 5.
        Step 5: Choose a Saving Throw
        Element
        +2 bonus to saves (DC -3)
        +1 bonus to saves (DC-1)
        +/-0 to saves (DC +0)
        -1 penalty to saves (DC +2)
        -2 penalty to saves (DC +5)
        -3 penalty to saves (DC +8)
        -4 penalty to saves (DC +10)
        -5 penalty to saves (DC +12)
        Overcoming Spell Resistance
        To ignore a target’s spell resistance declare to
        the Games Master your intention and figure
        the spell’s DC as per normal. Roll as per
        normal to see if he spell works, but the Games
        Master will deduct the total spell resistance of
        the target from your casting check.
        Step 6: Casting the Spell
        To cast a spell, the player should add together
        the DC numbers received by selecting options
        in steps one through five. The total of these
        numbers is the final DC which must be
        overcome by the chaos mage with a caster
        check to successfully cast the effect. If the
        check is successful, the spell goes off as
        expected.
        The casting check to successfully cast a chaos
        magic spell is:
        Chaos mage’s class level + Wisdom bonus +
        1d20 vs the total spell effect DC
        Chaos magic spells are cast as a standard
        action. They are assumed to provoke attacks
        of opportunity, as more traditional spells do,
        and require verbal and somatic components.
